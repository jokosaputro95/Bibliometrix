abstract={The rapid advances in the internet and communication fields have resulted in a huge increase in the network size and the corresponding data. As a result, many novel attacks are being generated and have posed challenges for network security to accurately detect intrusions. Furthermore, the presence of the intruders with the aim to launch various attacks within the network cannot be ignored. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is one such tool that prevents the network from possible intrusions by inspecting the network traffic, to ensure its confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Despite enormous efforts by the researchers, IDS still faces challenges in improving detection accuracy while reducing false alarm rates and in detecting novel intrusions. Recently, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)-based IDS systems are being deployed as potential solutions to detect intrusions across the network in an efficient manner. This article first clarifies the concept of IDS and then provides the taxonomy based on the notable ML and DL techniques adopted in designing network-based IDS (NIDS) systems. A comprehensive review of the recent NIDS-based articles is provided by discussing the strengths and limitations of the proposed solutions. Then, recent trends and advancements of ML and DL-based NIDS are provided in terms of the proposed methodology, evaluation metrics, and dataset selection. Using the shortcomings of the proposed methods, we highlighted various research challenges and provided the future scope for the research in improving ML and DL-based NIDS. © 2020 The Authors.

abstract={Intrusion detection can identify unknown attacks from network traffics and has been an effective means of network security. Nowadays, existing methods for network anomaly detection are usually based on traditional machine learning models, such as KNN, SVM, etc. Although these methods can obtain some outstanding features, they get a relatively low accuracy and rely heavily on manual design of traffic features, which has been obsolete in the age of big data. To solve the problems of low accuracy and feature engineering in intrusion detection, a traffic anomaly detection model BAT is proposed. The BAT model combines BLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-term memory) and attention mechanism. Attention mechanism is used to screen the network flow vector composed of packet vectors generated by the BLSTM model, which can obtain the key features for network traffic classification. In addition, we adopt multiple convolutional layers to capture the local features of traffic data. As multiple convolutional layers are used to process data samples, we refer BAT model as BAT-MC. The softmax classifier is used for network traffic classification. The proposed end-to-end model does not use any feature engineering skills and can automatically learn the key features of the hierarchy. It can well describe the network traffic behavior and improve the ability of anomaly detection effectively. We test our model on a public benchmark dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate our model has better performance than other comparison methods. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has been rapidly evolving towards making a greater impact on everyday life to large industrial systems. Unfortunately, this has attracted the attention of cybercriminals who made IoT a target of malicious activities, opening the door to a possible attack on the end nodes. To this end, Numerous IoT intrusion detection Systems (IDS) have been proposed in the literature to tackle attacks on the IoT ecosystem, which can be broadly classified based on detection technique, validation strategy, and deployment strategy. This survey paper presents a comprehensive review of contemporary IoT IDS and an overview of techniques, deployment Strategy, validation strategy and datasets that are commonly applied for building IDS. We also review how existing IoT IDS detect intrusive attacks and secure communications on the IoT. It also presents the classification of IoT attacks and discusses future research challenges to counter such IoT attacks to make IoT more secure. These purposes help IoT security researchers by uniting, contrasting, and compiling scattered research efforts. Consequently, we provide a unique IoT IDS taxonomy, which sheds light on IoT IDS techniques, their advantages and disadvantages, IoT attacks that exploit IoT communication systems, corresponding advanced IDS and detection capabilities to detect IoT attacks. © 2021, The Author(s).},

abstract={An intrusion detection system (IDS) is an important protection instrument for detecting complex network attacks. Various machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed for implementing anomaly-based IDS (AIDS). Our review of the AIDS literature identifies some issues in related work, including the randomness of the selected algorithms, parameters, and testing criteria, the application of old datasets, or shallow analyses and validation of the results. This paper comprehensively reviews previous studies on AIDS by using a set of criteria with different datasets and types of attacks to set benchmarking outcomes that can reveal the suitable AIDS algorithms, parameters, and testing criteria. Specifically, this paper applies 10 popular supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms for identifying effective and efficient ML-AIDS of networks and computers. These supervised ML algorithms include the artificial neural network (ANN), decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), naive Bayes (NB), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms, whereas the unsupervised ML algorithms include the expectation-maximization (EM), k-means, and self-organizing maps (SOM) algorithms. Several models of these algorithms are introduced, and the turning and training parameters of each algorithm are examined to achieve an optimal classifier evaluation. Unlike previous studies, this study evaluates the performance of AIDS by measuring the true positive and negative rates, accuracy, precision, recall, and F-Score of 31 ML-AIDS models. The training and testing time for ML-AIDS models are also considered in measuring their performance efficiency given that time complexity is an important factor in AIDSs. The ML-AIDS models are tested by using a recent and highly unbalanced multiclass CICIDS2017 dataset that involves real-world network attacks. In general, the k-NN-AIDS, DT-AIDS, and NB-AIDS models obtain the best results and show a greater capability in detecting web attacks compared with other models that demonstrate irregular and inferior results. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The growing development of IoT (Internet of Things) devices creates a large attack surface for cybercriminals to conduct potentially more destructive cyberattacks; as a result, the security industry has seen an exponential increase in cyber-attacks. Many of these attacks have effectively accomplished their malicious goals because intruders conduct cyber-attacks using novel and innovative techniques. An anomaly-based IDS (Intrusion Detection System) uses machine learning techniques to detect and classify attacks in IoT networks. In the presence of unpredictable network technologies and various intrusion methods, traditional machine learning techniques appear inefficient. In many research areas, deep learning methods have shown their ability to identify anomalies accurately. Convolutional neural networks are an excellent alternative for anomaly detection and classification due to their ability to automatically categorize main characteristics in input data and their effectiveness in performing faster computations. In this paper, we design and develop a novel anomaly-based intrusion detection model for IoT networks. First, a convolutional neural network model is used to create a multiclass classification model. The proposed model is then implemented using convolutional neural networks in 1D, 2D, and 3D. The proposed convolutional neural network model is validated using the BoT-IoT, IoT Network Intrusion, MQTT-IoT-IDS2020, and IoT-23 intrusion detection datasets. Transfer learning is used to implement binary and multiclass classification using a convolutional neural network multiclass pre-trained model. Our proposed binary and multiclass classification models have achieved high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score compared to existing deep learning implementations. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) idea has been developed to enhance people's lives by delivering a diverse range of smart interconnected devices and applications in several domains. However, security threats are main critical challenges for the devices in an IoT environment. Many approaches have been proposed to secure IoT appliances in state of the art, still advancement is desirable. Machine learning has demonstrated a capability to detect patterns when other methodologies have collapsed. One advanced method to enhance IoT security is to employ deep learning. This formulates a seamless option for anomaly-based detection. This paper presents a CNN-based approach for anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) that takes advantage of IoT's power, providing qualities to efficiently examine whole traffic across the IoT. The proposed model shows ability to detect any possible intrusion and abnormal traffic behavior. The model is trained and tested using the NID Dataset and BoT-IoT datasets and achieved an accuracy of 99.51% and 92.85%, respectively. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has lately developed into an innovation for developing smart environments. Security and privacy are viewed as main problems in any technology's dependence on the IoT model. Privacy and security issues arise due to the different possible attacks caused by intruders. Thus, there is an essential need to develop an intrusion detection system for attack and anomaly identification in the IoT system. In this work, we have proposed a deep learning-based method Deep Belief Network (DBN) algorithm model for the intrusion detection system. Regarding the attacks and anomaly detection, the CICIDS 2017 dataset is utilized for the performance analysis of the present IDS model. The proposed method produced better results in all the parameters in relation to accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, and detection rate. The proposed method has achieved 99.37% accuracy for normal class, 97.93% for Botnet class, 97.71% for Brute Force class, 96.67% for Dos/DDoS class, 96.37% for Infiltration class, 97.71% for Ports can class and 98.37% for Web attack, and these results were compared with various classifiers as shown in the results. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Anomalies are rare observations (e.g., data records or events) that deviate significantly from the others in the sample. Over the past few decades, research on anomaly mining has received increasing interests due to the implications of these occurrences in a wide range of disciplines - for instance, security, finance, and medicine. For this reason, anomaly detection, which aims to identify these rare observations, has become one of the most vital tasks in the world and has shown its power in preventing detrimental events, such as financial fraud, network intrusions, and social spam. The detection task is typically solved by identifying outlying data points in the feature space, which, inherently, overlooks the relational information in real-world data. At the same time, graphs have been prevalently used to represent the structural/relational information, which raises the graph anomaly detection problem - identifying anomalous graph objects (i.e., nodes, edges and sub-graphs) in a single graph, or anomalous graphs in a set/database of graphs. Conventional anomaly detection techniques cannot tackle this problem well because of the complexity of graph data (e.g., irregular structures, relational dependencies, node/edge types/attributes/directions/multiplicities/weights, large scale, etc.). However, thanks to the advent of deep learning in breaking these limitations, graph anomaly detection with deep learning has received a growing attention recently. In this survey, we aim to provide a systematic and comprehensive review of the contemporary deep learning techniques for graph anomaly detection. Specifically, we provide a taxonomy that follows a task-driven strategy and categorizes existing work according to the anomalous graph objects that they can detect. We especially focus on the challenges in this research area and discuss the key intuitions, technical details as well as relative strengths and weaknesses of various techniques in each category. From the survey results, we highlight 12 future research directions spanning unsolved and emerging problems introduced by graph data, anomaly detection, deep learning and real-world applications. Additionally, to provide a wealth of useful resources for future studies, we have compiled a set of open-source implementations, public datasets, and commonly-used evaluation metrics. With this survey, our goal is to create a 'one-stop-shop' that provides a unified understanding of the problem categories and existing approaches, publicly available hands-on resources, and high-impact open challenges for graph anomaly detection using deep learning. © 1989-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={With an increase in the number and types of network attacks, traditional firewalls and data encryption methods can no longer meet the needs of current network security. As a result, intrusion detection systems have been proposed to deal with network threats. The current mainstream intrusion detection algorithms are aided with machine learning but have problems of low detection rates and the need for extensive feature engineering. To address the issue of low detection accuracy, this paper proposes a model for traffic anomaly detection named a deep learning model for network intrusion detection (DLNID), which combines an attention mechanism and the bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) network, first extracting sequence features of data traffic through a convolutional neural network (CNN) network, then reassigning the weights of each channel through the attention mechanism, and finally using Bi-LSTM to learn the network of sequence features. In intrusion detection public data sets, there are serious imbalance data generally. To address data imbalance issues, this paper employs the method of adaptive synthetic sampling (ADASYN) for sample expansion of minority class samples, to eventually form a relatively symmetric dataset, and uses a modified stacked autoencoder for data dimensionality reduction with the objective of enhancing information fusion. DLNID is an end-to-end model, so it does not need to undergo the process of manual feature extraction. After being tested on the public benchmark dataset on network intrusion detection NSL-KDD, experimental results show that the accuracy and F1 score of this model are better than those of other comparison methods, reaching 90.73% and 89.65%, respectively. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Software-defined networking (SDN) is a new networking paradigm that separates the controller from the network devices i.e. routers and switches. The centralized architecture of the SDN facilitates the overall network management and addresses the requirement of current data centers. While there are high benefits offered by the SDN architecture, the risk of new attacks is a critical problem and can prevent the wide adoption of SDNs. The SDN controller is a crucial element, and it is an attractive target for the intruders. In case the attacker successfully accessed the SDN controller, it can route the traffic based on its own requirements, causing severe damage to the entire network. The network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) are important tools to detect and secure the network environment from malicious activities and anomalous attacks. Deep Learning (DL) has recently shown desirable results in a variety of problems, such as text, speech, and image applications, etc. While several related works deployed DL for NIDSs, most of these approaches ignore the influence of the overfitting problem during the implementation of DL algorithms. As a result, it can impact the robustness of the anomaly detection system and lead to poor model performance for zero-day attacks. In this work, we propose a new hybrid DL approach based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the flow traffic into normal or attack classes. A new regularizer method, namely SD-Reg, which is based on the standard deviation of the weight matrix, has been used to address the problem of overfitting and to improve the capability of NIDSs in detection of unseen intrusion events. The evaluation results indicate that the SD-Reg outperforms the previous regularizer methods. In addition, the proposed hybrid technique gives a higher performance in all the evaluation metrics compared to the single DL models. Several datasets, including the InSDN – the most recent dataset for SDN – are used to train and evaluate the performance of all techniques. Furthermore, we suggest a lightweight NIDS by training the CNN-based models using a less number of features without causing a significant drop in the model performance. © 2021 The Authors},

abstract={Network anomaly detection plays a crucial role as it provides an effective mechanism to block or stop cyberattacks. With the recent advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI), there has been a number of Autoencoder (AE) based deep learning approaches for network anomaly detection to improve our posture towards network security. The performance of existing state-of-the-art AE models used for network anomaly detection varies without offering a holistic approach to understand the critical impacts of the core set of important performance indicators of AE models and the detection accuracy. In this study, we propose a novel 5-layer autoencoder (AE)-based model better suited for network anomaly detection tasks. Our proposal is based on the results we obtained through an extensive and rigorous investigation of several performance indicators involved in an AE model. In our proposed model, we use a new data pre-processing methodology that transforms and removes the most affected outliers from the input samples to reduce model bias caused by data imbalance across different data types in the feature set. Our proposed model utilizes the most effective reconstruction error function which plays an essential role for the model to decide whether a network traffic sample is normal or anomalous. These sets of innovative approaches and the optimal model architecture allow our model to be better equipped for feature learning and dimension reduction thus producing better detection accuracy as well as f1-score. We evaluated our proposed model on the NSL-KDD dataset which outperformed other similar methods by achieving the highest accuracy and f1-score at 90.61% and 92.26% respectively in detection. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) play an important role in computer network security. There are several detection mechanisms where anomaly-based automated detection outperforms others significantly. Amid the sophistication and growing number of attacks, dealing with large amounts of data is a recognized issue in the development of anomaly-based NIDS. However, do current models meet the needs of today's networks in terms of required accuracy and dependability? In this research, we propose a new hybrid model that combines machine learning and deep learning to increase detection rates while securing dependability. Our proposed method ensures efficient pre-processing by combining SMOTE for data balancing and XGBoost for feature selection. We compared our developed method to various machine learning and deep learning algorithms in order to find a more efficient algorithm to implement in the pipeline. Furthermore, we chose the most effective model for network intrusion based on a set of benchmarked performance analysis criteria. Our method produces excellent results when tested on two datasets, KDDCUP’99 and CIC-MalMem-2022, with an accuracy of 99.99% and 100% for KDDCUP’99 and CIC-MalMem-2022, respectively, and no overfitting or Type-1 and Type-2 issues. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Cybersecurity is important today because of the increasing growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), which has resulted in a variety of attacks on computer systems and networks. Cyber security has become an increasingly difficult issue to manage as various IoT devices and services grow. Malicious traffic identification using deep learning techniques has emerged as a key component of network intrusion detection systems (IDS). Deep learning methods have been a research focus in network intrusion detection. A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is useful in a wide range of applications. First, this paper proposes a novel deep learning model for anomaly detection in IoT networks using a recurrent neural network. Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), BiLSTM, and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) techniques are used to implement the proposed model for anomaly detection in IoT networks. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can analyze input features without losing important information, making them particularly well suited for feature learning. Next, a hybrid deep learning model was proposed using convolutional and recurrent neural networks. Finally, a lightweight deep learning model for binary classification was proposed using LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU based approaches. The proposed deep learning models are validated using NSLKDD, BoT-IoT, IoT-NI, IoT-23, MQTT, MQTTset, and IoT-DS2 datasets. Compared to current deep learning implementations, the proposed multiclass and binary classification model achieved high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={With the rapid expansion of intelligent resource-constrained devices and high-speed communication technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT) has earned wide recognition as the primary standard for low-power lossy networks (LLNs). Nevertheless, IoT infrastructures are vulnerable to cyber-attacks due to the constraints in computation, storage, and communication capacity of the endpoint devices. From one side, the majority of newly developed cyber-attacks are formed by slightly mutating formerly established cyber-attacks to produce a new attack that tends to be treated as normal traffic through the IoT network. From the other side, the influence of coupling the deep learning techniques with the cybersecurity field has become a recent inclination of many security applications due to their impressive performance. In this paper, we provide the comprehensive development of a new intelligent and autonomous deep-learning-based detection and classification system for cyber-attacks in IoT communication networks that leverage the power of convolutional neural networks, abbreviated as IoT-IDCS-CNN (IoT based Intrusion Detection and Classification System using Convolutional Neural Network). The proposed IoT-IDCS-CNN makes use of high-performance computing that employs the robust Compute Unified Device Architectures (CUDA) based Nvidia GPUs (Graphical Processing Units) and parallel processing that employs high-speed I9-core-based Intel CPUs. In particular, the proposed system is composed of three subsystems: a feature engineering subsystem, a feature learning subsystem, and a traffic classification subsystem. All subsystems were developed, verified, integrated, and validated in this research. To evaluate the developed system, we employed the Network Security Laboratory-Knowledge Discovery Databases (NSL-KDD) dataset, which includes all the key attacks in IoT computing. The simulation results demonstrated a greater than 99.3% and 98.2% cyber-attack classification accuracy for the binary-class classifier (normal vs. anomaly) and the multiclass classifier (five categories), respectively. The proposed system was validated using a K-fold cross-validation method and was evaluated using the confusion matrix parameters (i.e., true negative (TN), true positive (TP), false negative (FN), false positive (FP)), along with other classification performance metrics, including precision, recall, F1-score, and false alarm rate. The test and evaluation results of the IoT-IDCS-CNN system outperformed many recent machine-learning-based IDCS systems in the same area of study. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Currently, expert systems and applied machine learning algorithms are widely used to automate network intrusion detection. In critical infrastructure applications of communication technologies, the interaction among various industrial control systems and the Internet environment intrinsic to the IoT technology makes them susceptible to cyber-attacks. Given the existence of the enormous network traffic in critical Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), traditional methods of machine learning implemented in network anomaly detection are inefficient. Therefore, recently developed machine learning techniques, with the emphasis on deep learning, are finding their successful implementations in the detection and classification of anomalies at both the network and host levels. This paper presents an ensemble method that leverages deep models such as the Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and a meta-classifier (i.e., logistic regression) following the principle of stacked generalization. To enhance the capabilities of the proposed approach, the method utilizes a two-step process for the apprehension of network anomalies. In the first stage, data pre-processing, a Deep Sparse AutoEncoder (DSAE) is employed for the feature engineering problem. In the second phase, a stacking ensemble learning approach is utilized for classification. The efficiency of the method disclosed in this work is tested on heterogeneous datasets, including data gathered in the IoT environment, namely IoT-23, LITNET-2020, and NetML-2020. The results of the evaluation of the proposed approach are discussed. Statistical significance is tested and compared to the state-of-the-art approaches in network anomaly detection. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Over the last few years, Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm has become an emerging architecture to design future networks and to meet new application demands. SDN provides resources for improving network control and management by separating control and data plane, and the logical control is centralized in a controller. However, the centralized control logic can be an ideal target for malicious attacks, mainly Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Recently, Deep Learning has become a powerful technique applied in cybersecurity, and many Network Intrusion Detection (NIDS) have been proposed in recent researches. Some studies have indicated that deep neural networks are sensitive in detecting adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks are instances with certain perturbations that cause deep neural networks to misclassify. In this paper, we proposed a detection and defense system based on Adversarial training in SDN, which uses Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework for detecting DDoS attacks and applies adversarial training to make the system less sensitive to adversarial attacks. The proposed system includes well-defined modules that enable continuous traffic monitoring using IP flow analysis, enabling the anomaly detection system to act in near-real-time. We conducted the experiments on two distinct scenarios, with emulated data and the public dataset CICDDoS 2019. Experimental results demonstrated that the system efficiently detected up-to-date common types of DDoS attacks compared to other approaches. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Due to the rapid growth in network traffic and increasing security threats, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have become increasingly critical in the field of cyber security for providing secure communications against cyber adversaries. However, there exist many challenges for designing a robust, efficient and accurate IDS, especially when dealing with high-dimensional anomaly data with unforeseen and unpredictable attacks. In this paper, we propose a Robust Transformer-based Intrusion Detection System (RTIDS) reconstructing feature representations to make a trade-off between dimensionality reduction and feature retention in imbalanced datasets. The proposed method utilizes positional embedding technique to associate sequential information between features, then a variant stacked encoder-decoder neural network is used to learn low-dimensional feature representations from high-dimensional raw data. Furthermore, we apply self-attention mechanism to facilitate network traffic type classifications. Extensive experiments reveal the effectiveness of the proposed RTIDS on two publicly available real traffic intrusion detection datasets named CICIDS2017 and CIC-DDoS2019 with F1-Score of 99.17% and 98.48% respectively. A comparative study with classical machine learning algorithm support vector machine (SVM) and deep learning algorithms that include recurrent neural network (RNN), fuzzy neural network (FNN), and long short-term memory network (LSTM) is conducted to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), connected objects produce an enormous amount of data traffic that feed big data analytics, which could be used in discovering unseen patterns and identifying anomalous traffic. In this paper, we identify five key design principles that should be considered when developing a deep learning-based intrusion detection system (IDS) for the IoT. Based on these principles, we design and implement Temporal Convolution Neural Network (TCNN), a deep learning framework for intrusion detection systems in IoT, which combines Convolution Neural Network (CNN) with causal convolution. TCNN is combined with Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique-Nominal Continuous (SMOTE-NC) to handle unbalanced dataset. It is also combined with efficient feature engineering techniques, which consist of feature space reduction and feature transformation. TCNN is evaluated on Bot-IoT dataset and compared with two common machine learning algorithms, i.e., Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF), and two deep learning techniques, i.e., LSTM and CNN. Experimental results show that TCNN achieves a good trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency. It outperforms the state-of-The-Art deep learning IDSs that are tested on Bot-IoT dataset and records an accuracy of 99.9986% for multiclass traffic detection, and shows a very close performance to CNN with respect to the training time. © 2020 Abdelouahid Derhab et al.},

abstract={The revolutionary idea of the internet of things (IoT) architecture has gained enormous popularity over the last decade, resulting in an exponential growth in the IoT networks, connected devices, and the data processed therein. Since IoT devices generate and exchange sensitive data over the traditional internet, security has become a prime concern due to the generation of zero-day cyberattacks. A network-based intrusion detection system (NIDS) can provide the much-needed efficient security solution to the IoT network by protecting the network entry points through constant network traffic monitoring. Recent NIDS have a high false alarm rate (FAR) in detecting the anomalies, including the novel and zero-day anomalies. This paper proposes an efficient anomaly detection mechanism using mutual information (MI), considering a deep neural network (DNN) for an IoT network. A comparative analysis of different deep-learning models such as DNN, Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, and its different variants, such as Gated Recurrent Unit and Long Short-term Memory is performed considering the IoT-Botnet 2020 dataset. Experimental results show the improvement of 0.57–2.6% in terms of the model’s accuracy, while at the same time reducing the FAR by 0.23–7.98% to show the effectiveness of the DNN-based NIDS model compared to the well-known deep learning models. It was also observed that using only the 16–35 best numerical features selected using MI instead of 80 features of the dataset result in almost negligible degradation in the model’s performance but helped in decreasing the overall model’s complexity. In addition, the overall accuracy of the DL-based models is further improved by almost 0.99–3.45% in terms of the detection accuracy considering only the top five categorical and numerical features. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) applications are growing in popularity for being widely used in many real-world services. In an IoT ecosystem, many devices are connected with each other via internet, making IoT networks more vulnerable to various types of cyber attacks, thus a major concern in its deployment is network security and user privacy. To protect IoT networks against various attacks, an efficient and practical Intrusion Detection System (IDS) could be an effective solution. In this paper, a novel anomaly-based IDS system for IoT networks is proposed using Deep Learning technique. Particularly, a filter-based feature selection Deep Neural Network (DNN) model where highly correlated features are dropped has been presented. Further, the model is tuned with various parameters and hyper parameters. The UNSW-NB15 dataset comprising of four attack classes is utilized for this purpose. The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 84%. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) were used to generate synthetic data of minority attacks to resolve class imbalance issues in the dataset and achieved 91% accuracy with balanced class dataset. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Automotive security has gained significant traction in the last decade thanks to the development of new connectivity features that have brought the vehicle from an isolated environment to an externally facing domain. Researchers have shown that modern vehicles are vulnerable to multiple types of attacks leveraging remote, direct and indirect physical access, which allow attackers to gain control and affect safety-critical systems. Conversely, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have been proposed by both industry and academia to identify attacks and anomalous behaviours. In this article, we propose CANnolo, an IDS based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-autoencoders to identify anomalies in Controller Area Networks (CANs). During a training phase, CANnolo automatically analyzes the CAN streams and builds a model of the legitimate data sequences. Then, it detects anomalies by computing the difference between the reconstructed and the respective real sequences. We experimentally evaluated CANnolo on a set of simulated attacks applied over a real-world dataset. We show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art model by improving the detection rate and precision. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Recently, due to the rapid development and remarkable result of deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) approaches in various domains for several long-standing artificial intelligence (AI) tasks, there has an extreme interest in applying toward network security too. Nowadays, in the information communication technology (ICT) era, the intrusion detection (ID) system has the great potential to be the frontier of security against cyberattacks and plays a vital role in achieving network infrastructure and resources. Conventional ID systems are not strong enough to detect advanced malicious threats. Heterogeneity is one of the important features of big data. Thus, designing an efficient ID system using a heterogeneous dataset is a massive research problem. There are several ID datasets openly existing for more research by the cybersecurity researcher community. However, no existing research has shown a detailed performance evaluation of several ML methods on various publicly available ID datasets. Due to the dynamic nature of malicious attacks with continuously changing attack detection methods, ID datasets are available publicly and are updated systematically. In this research, spark MLlib (machine learning library)-based robust classical ML classifiers for anomaly detection and state of the art DL, such as the convolutional-auto encoder (Conv-AE) for misuse attack, is used to develop an efficient and intelligent ID system to detect and classify unpredictable malicious attacks. To measure the effectiveness of our proposed ID system, we have used several important performance metrics, such as FAR, DR, and accuracy, while experiments are conducted on the publicly existing dataset, specifically the contemporary heterogeneous CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Software Defined Networking (SDN) is an emerging network platform, which facilitates centralised network management. The SDN enables the network operators to manage the overall network consistently and holistically, regardless the complexity of infrastructure devices. The promising features of the SDN enhance network security and facilitate the implementation of threat detection systems through software applications using open APIs. However, the emerging technology creates new security concerns and new threats that do not exist in the current traditional networks. Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDoS) are one of the most rampant attacks that can interrupt the functionality of the network and make most of the network services unreachable for network users. The efficient identification of DDos attacks on SDN environments in literature is still a challenge because of the number of network features taken into account and the overhead of applying machine learning based anomaly detection techniques. Hence, in this paper, we aim to use two popular feature selection methods, i.e., Information Gain (IG) and Random Forest (RF) in order to analyse the most comprehensive relevant features of DDoS attacks in SDN networks. Using the most relevant features will improve the accuracy of the anomaly detection system and reduce the false alarm rates. Moreover, we propose a Deep Learning (DL) technique based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Autoencoder to tackle the problem of DDoS attacks in SDNs. We perform our analysis and evaluation on three different datasets, i.e., InSDN, CICIDS2017 and CICIDS2018. We also measure the overhead of the proposed DL model on the SDN controller and test the network performance in terms of network throughput and end-to-end latency. The results validate that the DL approach can efficiently identify DDoS attacks in SDN environments without any significant degradation in the controller performance. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper investigates graph neural networks (GNNs) applied for self-supervised intrusion and anomaly detection in computer networks. GNNs are a deep learning approach for graph-based data that incorporate graph structures into learning to generalise graph representations and output embeddings. As traffic flows in computer networks naturally exhibit a graph structure, GNNs are a suitable fit in this context. The majority of current implementations of GNN-based network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) rely on labelled network traffic. This limits the volume and structure of input traffic and restricts the NIDSs’ potential to adapt to unseen attacks. These systems also rely on the use of node features, which may reduce the detection accuracy of these systems, as important edge (packet-level) information is not leveraged. To overcome these restrictions, we present Anomal-E, a GNN approach to intrusion and anomaly detection that leverages edge features and a graph topological structure in a self-supervised manner. This approach is, to the best of our knowledge, the first successful and practical approach to network intrusion detection that utilises network flows in a self-supervised, edge-leveraging GNN. Experimental results on two modern benchmark NIDS datasets display a significant improvement when using Anomal-E compared to raw features and other baseline algorithms. This additionally posits the potential Anomal-E has for intrusion detection on real-world network traffic. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) has taken a prominent role in the network security management field, due to the substantial number of sophisticated attacks that often pass undetected through classic IDSs. These are typically aimed at recognizing attacks based on a specific signature, or at detecting anomalous events. However, deterministic, rule-based methods often fail to differentiate particular (rarer) network conditions (as in peak traffic during specific network situations) from actual cyber attacks. In this article we provide an experimental-based review of neural-based methods applied to intrusion detection issues. Specifically, we i) offer a complete view of the most prominent neural-based techniques relevant to intrusion detection, including deep-based approaches or weightless neural networks, which feature surprising outcomes; ii) evaluate novel datasets (updated w.r.t. the obsolete KDD99 set) through a designed-from-scratch Python-based routine; iii) perform experimental analyses including time complexity and performance (accuracy and F-measure), considering both single-class and multi-class problems, and identifying trade-offs between resource consumption and performance. Our evaluation quantifies the value of neural networks, particularly when state-of-the-art datasets are used to train the models. This leads to interesting guidelines for security managers and computer network practitioners who are looking at the incorporation of neural-based ML into IDS. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Although the field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has a significant interest these days, its implementation within cyber security applications still needs further investigation to understand its effectiveness in discovering attack surfaces and vectors. In cyber defence, especially anomaly-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), the emerging applications of machine/deep learning models require the interpretation of the models' architecture and the explanation of models' prediction to examine how cyberattacks would occur. This paper proposes a novel explainable intrusion detection framework in the Internet of Things (IoT) networks. We have developed an IDS using a Short-Term Long Memory (LSTM) model to identify cyberattacks and explain the model's decisions. This uses a novel set of input features extracted by a novel SPIP (S: Shapley Additive exPlanations, P: Permutation Feature Importance, I: Individual Conditional Expectation, P: Partial Dependence Plot) framework to train and evaluate the LSTM model. The framework was validated using the NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15 and TON_IoT datasets. The SPIP framework achieved high detection accuracy, processing time, and high interpretability of data features and model outputs compared with other peer techniques. The proposed framework has the potential to assist administrators and decision-makers in understanding complex attack behaviour. © 2023 The Author(s)},

abstract={Neural networks (NNs) are increasingly popular in developing NIDS, yet can prove vulnerable to adversarial examples. Through these, attackers that may be oblivious to the precise mechanics of the targeted NIDS add subtle perturbations to malicious traffic features, with the aim of evading detection and disrupting critical systems. Defending against such adversarial attacks is of high importance, but requires to address daunting challenges. Here, we introduce TIKI- TAKA, a general framework for (i) assessing the robustness of state-of-the-art deep learning-based NIDS against adversarial manipulations, and which (ii) incorporates defense mechanisms that we propose to increase resistance to attacks employing such evasion techniques. Specifically, we select five cutting-edge adversarial attack types to subvert three popular malicious traffic detectors that employ NNs. We experiment with publicly available datasets and consider both one-to-all and one-to-one classification scenarios, i.e., discriminating illicit vs benign traffic and respectively identifying specific types of anomalous traffic among many observed. The results obtained reveal that attackers can evade NIDS with up to 35.7% success rates, by only altering time-based features of the traffic generated. To counteract these weaknesses, we propose three defense mechanisms: model voting ensembling, ensembling adversarial training, and query detection. We demonstrate that these methods can restore intrusion detection rates to nearly 100% against most types of malicious traffic, and attacks with potentially catastrophic consequences (e.g., botnet) can be thwarted. This confirms the effectiveness of our solutions and makes the case for their adoption when designing robust and reliable deep anomaly detectors. © 1993-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose DiFF-RF, an ensemble approach composed of random partitioning binary trees to detect point-wise and collective (as well as contextual) anomalies. Thanks to a distance-based paradigm used at the leaves of the trees, this semi-supervised approach solves a drawback that has been identified in the isolation forest (IF) algorithm. Moreover, taking into account the frequencies of visits in the leaves of the random trees allows to significantly improve the performance of DiFF-RF when considering the presence of collective anomalies. DiFF-RF is fairly easy to train, and good performance can be obtained by using a simple semi-supervised procedure to setup the extra hyper-parameter that is introduced. We first evaluate DiFF-RF on a synthetic data set to i) verify that the limitation of the IF algorithm is overcome, ii) demonstrate how collective anomalies are actually detected and iii) to analyze the effect of the meta-parameters it involves. We assess the DiFF-RF algorithm on a large set of datasets from the UCI repository, as well as four benchmarks related to network intrusion detection applications. Our experiments show that DiFF-RF almost systematically outperforms the IF algorithm and one of its extended variant, but also challenges the one-class SVM baseline, deep learning variational auto-encoder and ensemble of auto-encoder architectures. Finally, DiFF-RF is computationally efficient and can be easily parallelized on multi-core architectures. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The development of robust anomaly-based network detection systems, which are preferred over static signal-based network intrusion, is vital for cybersecurity. The development of a flexible and dynamic security system is required to tackle the new attacks. Current intrusion detection systems (IDSs) suffer to attain both the high detection rate and low false alarm rate. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose an IDS using different machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. This paper presents a comparative analysis of different ML models and DL models on Coburg intrusion detection datasets (CIDDSs). First, we compare different ML-and DL-based models on the CIDDS dataset. Second, we propose an ensemble model that combines the best ML and DL models to achieve high-performance metrics. Finally, we benchmarked our best models with the CIC-IDS2017 dataset and compared them with state-of-the-art models. While the popular IDS datasets like KDD99 and NSL-KDD fail to represent the recent attacks and suffer from network biases, CIDDS, used in this research, encompasses labeled flow-based data in a simulated office environment with both updated attacks and normal usage. Furthermore, both accuracy and interpretability must be considered while implementing AI models. Both ML and DL models achieved an accuracy of 99% on the CIDDS dataset with a high detection rate, low false alarm rate, and relatively low training costs. Feature importance was also studied using the Classification and regression tree (CART) model. Our models performed well in 10-fold cross-validation and independent testing. CART and convolutional neural network (CNN) with embedding achieved slightly better performance on the CIC-IDS2017 dataset compared to previous models. Together, these results suggest that both ML and DL methods are robust and complementary techniques as an effective network intrusion detection system. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Software Defined Networking (SDN) is developing as a new solution for the development and innovation of the Internet. SDN is expected to be the ideal future for the Internet, since it can provide a controllable, dynamic, and cost-effective network. The emergence of SDN provides a unique opportunity to achieve network security in a more efficient and flexible manner. However, SDN also has original structural vulnerabilities, which are the centralized controller, the control-data interface and the control-application interface. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by intruders to conduct several types of attacks. In this paper, we propose a deep learning (DL) approach for a network intrusion detection system (DeepIDS) in the SDN architecture. Our models are trained and tested with the NSL-KDD dataset and achieved an accuracy of 80.7% and 90% for a Fully Connected Deep Neural Network (DNN) and a Gated Recurrent Neural Network (GRU-RNN), respectively. Through experiments, we confirm that the DL approach has the potential for flow-based anomaly detection in the SDN environment. We also evaluate the performance of our system in terms of throughput, latency, and resource utilization. Our test results show that DeepIDS does not affect the performance of the OpenFlow controller and so is a feasible approach. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The high dimension, complexity, and imbalance of network data are hot issues in the field of intrusion detection. Nowadays, intrusion detection systems face some challenges in improving the accuracy of minority classes detection, detecting unknown attacks, and reducing false alarm rates. To address the above problems, we propose a novel multi-module integrated intrusion detection system, namely GMM-WGAN-IDS. The system consists of three parts, such as feature extraction, imbalance processing, and classification. Firstly, the stacked autoencoder-based feature extraction module (SAE module) is proposed to obtain a deeper representation of the data. Secondly, on the basis of combining the clustering algorithm based on gaussian mixture model and the wasserstein generative adversarial network based on gaussian mixture model, the imbalance processing module (GMM-WGAN) is proposed. Thirdly, the classification module (CNN-LSTM) is designed based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM). We evaluate the performance of GMM-WGAN-IDS on the NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets, comparing it with other intrusion detection methods. Finally, the experimental results show that our proposed GMM-WGAN-IDS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and achieves better performance. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The dynamics of computer networks have changed rapidly over the past few years due to a tremendous increase in the volume of the connected devices and the corresponding applications. This growth in the network's size and our dependence on it for all aspects of our life have therefore resulted in the generation of many attacks on the network by malicious parties that are either novel or the mutations of the older attacks. These attacks pose many challenges for network security personnel to protect the computer and network nodes and corresponding data from possible intrusions. A network intrusion detection system (NIDS) can act as one of the efficient security solutions by constantly monitoring the network traffic to secure the entry points of a network. Despite enormous efforts by researchers, NIDS still suffers from a high false alarm rate (FAR) in detecting novel attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel NIDS framework based on a deep convolution neural network that utilizes network spectrogram images generated using the short-time Fourier transform. To test the efficiency of our proposed solution, we evaluated it using the CIC-IDS2017 dataset. The experimental results have shown about 2.5% - 4% improvement in accurately detecting intrusions compared to other deep learning (DL) algorithms while at the same time reducing the FAR by 4.3%-6.7% considering binary classification scenario. We also observed its efficiency for a 7-class classification scenario by achieving almost 98.75% accuracy with 0.56% - 3.72% improvement compared to other DL methodologies. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Despite its technological benefits, the Internet of Things (IoT) has cyber weaknesses due to vulnerabilities in the wireless medium. Machine Larning (ML)-based methods are widely used against cyber threats in IoT networks with promising performance. An Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) is prominent for cybercriminals to compromise networks, and it is crucial to long-Term and harmful characteristics. However, it is difficult to apply ML-based approaches to identify APT attacks to obtain a promising detection performance due to an extremely small percentage among normal traffic. There are limited surveys that fully investigate APT attacks in IoT networks due to the lack of public datasets with all types of APT attacks. It is worth bridging the state of the art in network attack detection with APT attack detection in a comprehensive review article. This survey article reviews the security challenges in IoT networks and presents well-known attacks, APT attacks, and threat models in IoT systems. Meanwhile, signature-based, anomaly-based, and hybrid intrusion detection systems are summarized for IoT networks. The article highlights statistical insights regarding frequently applied ML-based methods against network intrusion. Finally, open issues and challenges for common network intrusion and APT attacks are presented for future research. © 2022 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.},

abstract={Flying Ad Hoc Network (FANET) or drones’ technologies have gained much attraction in the last few years due to their critical applications. Therefore, various studies have been conducted on facilitating FANET applications in different fields. In fact, civil airspaces have gradually adopted FANET technology in their systems. However, FANET’s special roles made it complex to support emerging security threats, especially intrusion detection. This paper is a step forward towards the advances in FANET intrusion detection techniques. It investigates FANET intrusion detection threats by introducing a real-time data analytics framework based on deep learning. The framework consists of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) as a base. It also involves collecting data from the network and analyzing it using big data analytics for anomaly detection. The data collection is performed through an agent working inside each FANET. The agent is assumed to log the FANET real-time information. In addition, it involves a stream processing module that collects the drones’ communication information, including intrusion detection-related information. This information is fed into two RNN modules for data analysis, trained for this purpose. One of the RNN modules resides inside the FANET itself, and the second module resides at the base station. An extensive set of experiments were conducted based on various datasets to examine the efficiency of the proposed framework. The results showed that the proposed framework is superior to other recent approaches. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={With an increasing number of services connected to the internet, including cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) systems, the prevention of cyberattacks has become more challenging due to the high dimensionality of the network traffic data and access points. Recently, researchers have suggested deep learning (DL) algorithms to define intrusion features through training empirical data and learning anomaly patterns of attacks. However, due to the high dynamics and imbalanced nature of the data, the existing DL classifiers are not completely effective at distinguishing between abnormal and normal behavior line connections for modern networks. Therefore, it is important to design a self-adaptive model for an intrusion detection system (IDS) to improve the detection of attacks. Consequently, in this paper, a novel hybrid weighted deep belief network (HW-DBN) algorithm is proposed for building an efficient and reliable IDS (DeepIoT.IDS) model to detect existing and novel cyberattacks. The HW-DBN algorithm integrates an improved Gaussian-Bernoulli restricted Boltzmann machine (Deep GB-RBM) feature learning operator with a weighted deep neural networks (WDNN) classifier. The CICIDS2017 dataset is selected to evaluate the DeepIoT.IDS model as it contains multiple types of attacks, complex data patterns, noise values, and imbalanced classes. We have compared the performance of the DeepIoT.IDS model with three recent models. The results show the DeepIoT.IDS model outperforms the three other models by achieving a higher detection accuracy of 99.38% and 99.99% for web attack and bot attack scenarios, respectively. Furthermore, it can detect the occurrence of low-frequency attacks that are undetectable by other models. © 2021 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Recently, with the massive growth of IoT devices, the attack surfaces have also intensified. Thus, cybersecurity has become a critical component to protect organizational boundaries. In networks, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are employed to raise critical flags during network management. One aspect is malicious traffic identification, where zero-day attack detection is a critical problem of study. Current approaches are aligned towards deep learning (DL) methods for IDSs, but the success of the DL mechanism depends on the feature learning process, which is an open challenge. Thus, in this paper, the authors propose a technique which combines both CNN, and GRU, where different CNN–GRU combination sequences are presented to optimize the network parameters. In the simulation, the authors used the CICIDS-2017 benchmark dataset and used metrics such as precision, recall, False Positive Rate (FPR), True Positive Rate (TRP), and other aligned metrics. The results suggest a significant improvement, where many network attacks are detected with an accuracy of 98.73%, and an FPR rate of 0.075. We also performed a comparative analysis with other existing techniques, and the obtained results indicate the efficacy of the proposed IDS scheme in real cybersecurity setups. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) utilise deep learning techniques to identify intrusions with maximum accuracy and reduce false alarm rates. The feature extraction is also automated in these techniques. In this paper, an ensemble of different Deep Neural Network (DNN) models like MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP), BackPropagation Network (BPN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) are stacked to build a robust anomaly detection model. The performance of the ensemble model is analysed on different datasets, namely UNSW-NB15 and a campus generated dataset named VIT SPARC20. Other types of traffic, namely unencrypted normal traffic, normal encrypted traffic, encrypted and unencrypted malicious traffic, are captured in the VIT SPARC20 dataset. Encrypted normal and malicious traffic of VIT SPARC20 is categorised by the deep learning models without decrypting its contents, thus preserving the confidentiality and integrity of the data transmitted. XGBoost integrates the results of each deep learning model to achieve higher accuracy. From experimental analysis, it is inferred that UNSW NB results in a maximal accuracy of 99.5%. The performance of VIT_SPARC20 in terms of accuracy, precision and recall are 99.4%. 98% and 97%, respectively. © 2021 Sumaiya Thaseen Ikram et al., published by Sciendo.},

abstract={Internet-of-Things (IoT) connects various physical objects through the Internet and it has a wide application, such as in transportation, military, healthcare, agriculture, and many more. Those applications are increasingly popular because they address real-time problems. In contrast, the use of transmission and communication protocols has raised serious security concerns for IoT devices, and traditional methods such as signature and rule-based methods are inefficient for securing these devices. Hence, identifying network traffic behavior and mitigating cyber attacks are important in IoT to provide guaranteed network security. Therefore, we develop an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) based on a deep learning model called Pearson-Correlation Coefficient - Convolutional Neural Networks (PCC-CNN) to detect network anomalies. The PCC-CNN model combines the important features obtained from the linear-based extractions followed by the Convolutional Neural Network. It performs a binary classification for anomaly detection and also a multiclass classification for various types of attacks. The model is evaluated on three publicly available datasets: NSL-KDD, CICIDS-2017, and IOTID20. We first train and test five different (Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, K Nearest Neighbour, Classification and Regression Tree,& Support Vector Machine) PCC-based Machine Learning models to evaluate the model performance. We achieve the best similar accuracy from the KNN and CART model of 98%, 99%, and 98%, respectively, on the three datasets. On the other hand, we achieve a promising performance with a better detection accuracy of 99.89% and with a low misclassification rate of 0.001 with our proposed PCC-CNN model. The integrated model is promising, with a misclassification rate (or False alarm rate) of 0.02, 0.02, and 0.00 with Binary and Multiclass intrusion detection classifiers. Finally, we compare and discuss our PCC-CNN model in comparison to five traditional PCC-ML models. Our proposed Deep Learning (DL)-based IDS outperforms traditional methods. © The Author(s) 2023.},

abstract={Internet evolution produced a connected world with a massive amount of data. This connectivity advantage came with the price of more complex and advanced attacks. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is an essential component for security in modern networks. The IDS methodology is either signature-based detection or anomaly behavior detection. Recently, researchers adopted Deep Learning (DL) because it has a better performance than traditional machine learning algorithms. The use of DL to produce a model for the IDS may take a long time because of computation complexity and a large number of hyperparameters. Different DL models for IDS on Apache Spark have been implemented in this article. This article uses the famous Network Security Lab - Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (NSL-KDD) dataset and presents a computation delay comparison between Apache Spark and regular implementation. Moreover, an enhanced model is used to improve attack detection accuracy. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been a hot research topic because of its ability to detect new threats rather than only memorized signatures threats of signature-based IDS. Especially after the availability of advanced technologies that increase the number of hacking tools and increase the risk impact of an attack. The problem of any anomaly-based model is its high false-positive rate. The high false-positive rate is the reason why anomaly IDS is not commonly applied in practice. Because anomaly-based models classify an unseen pattern as a threat where it may be normal but not included in the training dataset. This type of problem is called overfitting where the model is not able to generalize. Optimizing Anomaly-based models by having a big training dataset that includes all possible normal cases may be an optimal solution but could not be applied in practice. Although we can increase the number of training samples to include much more normal cases, still we need a model that has more ability to generalize. In this research paper, we propose applying deep model instead of traditional models because it has more ability to generalize. Thus, we will obtain less false-positive by using big data and deep model. We made a comparison between machine learning and deep learning algorithms in the optimization of anomaly-based IDS by decreasing the false-positive rate. We did an experiment on the NSL-KDD benchmark and compared our results with one of the best used classifiers in traditional learning in IDS optimization. The experiment shows 10% lower false-positive by using deep learning instead of traditional learning. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={Computer viruses, malicious, and other hostile attacks can affect a computer network. Intrusion detection is a key component of network security as an active defence technology. Traditional intrusion detection systems struggle with issues like poor accuracy, ineffective detection, a high percentage of false positives, and an inability to handle new types of intrusions. To address these issues, we propose a deep learning-based novel method to detect cybersecurity vulnerabilities and breaches in cyber-physical systems. The proposed framework contrasts the unsupervised and deep learning-based discriminative approaches. This paper presents a generative adversarial network to detect cyber threats in IoT-driven IICs networks. The results demonstrate a performance increase of approximately 95% to 97% in terms of accuracy, reliability, and efficiency in detecting all types of attacks with a dropout value of 0.2 and an epoch value of 25. The output of well-known state-of-the-art DL classifiers achieved the highest true rate (TNR) and highest detection rate (HDR) when detecting the following attacks: (BruteForceXXS, BruteForceWEB, DoS_Hulk_Attack, and DOS_LOIC_HTTP_Attack) on the NSL-KDD, KDDCup99, and UNSW-NB15 datasets. It also maintained the confidentiality and integrity of users' and systems' sensitive information during the training and testing phases. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Anomaly detection has been known as an effective technique to detect faults or cyber-attacks in industrial control systems (ICS). Therefore, many anomaly detection models have been proposed for ICS. However, most models have been implemented and evaluated under specific circumstances, which leads to confusion about choosing the best model in a real-world situation. In other words, there still needs to be a comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art anomaly detection models with common experimental configurations. To address this problem, we conduct a comparative study of five representative time series anomaly detection models: InterFusion, RANSynCoder, GDN, LSTM-ED, and USAD. We specifically compare the performance analysis of the models in detection accuracy, training, and testing times with two publicly available datasets: SWaT and HAI. The experimental results show that the best model results are inconsistent with the datasets. For SWaT, InterFusion achieves the highest (Formula presented.) - (Formula presented.) of 90.7% while RANSynCoder achieves the highest (Formula presented.) - (Formula presented.) of 82.9% for HAI. We also investigate the effects of the training set size on the performance of anomaly detection models. We found that about 40% of the entire training set would be sufficient to build a model producing a similar performance compared to using the entire training set. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={Intrusion Detection System (IDS) plays a crucial role in detecting and identifying the DoS and DDoS type of attacks on IoT devices. However, anomaly-based techniques do not provide acceptable accuracy for efficacious intrusion detection. Also, we found many difficulty levels when applying IDS to IoT devices for identifying attempted attacks. Given this background, we designed a solution to detect intrusions using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Enhanced Data rates for GSM Evolution (EDGE) Computing. We created two separate categories to handle the attack and non-attack events in the system. The findings of this study indicate that this approach was significantly effective. We attempted both multiclass and binary classification. In the case of binary, we clustered all malicious traffic data in a single class. Also, we developed 13 layers of Sequential 1-D CNN for IDS detection and assessed them on the public dataset NSL-KDD. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was implemented to decrease the size of the feature vector based on feature extraction and engineering. The approach proposed in the current investigation obtained accuracies of 99.34% and 99.13% for binary and multiclass classification, respectively, for the NSL-KDD dataset. The experimental outcomes showed that the proposed PrincipalComponent-based Convolution Neural Network (PCCNN) approach achieved greater precision based on deep learning and has potential use in modern intrusion detection for IoT systems. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is a disruptive technology for the future decades. Due to its pervasive growth, it is susceptible to cyber-attacks, and hence the significance of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for IoT is pertinent. The viability of machine learning has encouraged analysts to apply learning techniques to intelligently discover and recognize cyber attacks and unusual behavior among the IoTs. This paper proposes an enhanced anomaly-based Intrusion Detection Deep learning Multi-class classification model (EIDM) that can classify 15 traffic behaviors including 14 attack types with the accuracy of 95% contained in the CICIDS2017 dataset. Four state-of-the-art deep learning models are also customized to classify six classes of network traffic behavior. An extensive comparative study in terms of classification accuracy and efficiency metrics is conducted between EIDM and several state-of-the-art deep learning-based IDSs showing that EIDM has achieved accurate detection results. © 2023, The Author(s).},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is a key enabler in closing the loop in Cyber-Physical Systems, providing “smartness” and thus additional value to each monitored/controlled physical asset. Unfortunately, these devices are more and more targeted by cyberattacks because of their diffusion and of the usually limited hardware and software resources. This calls for designing and evaluating new effective approaches for protecting IoT systems at the network level (Network Intrusion Detection Systems, NIDSs). These in turn are challenged by the heterogeneity of IoT devices and the growing volume of transmitted data. To tackle this challenge, we select a Deep Learning architecture to perform unsupervised early anomaly detection. With a data-driven approach, we explore in-depth multiple design choices and exploit the appealing structural properties of the selected architecture to enhance its performance. The experimental evaluation is performed on two recent and publicly available IoT datasets (IoT-23 and Kitsune). Finally, we adopt an adversarial approach to investigate the robustness of our solution in the presence of Label Flipping poisoning attacks. The experimental results highlight the improved performance of the proposed architecture, in comparison to both well-known baselines and previous proposals. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The extensive proliferation of modern information services and ubiquitous digitization of society have raised cybersecurity challenges to new levels. With the massive number of connected devices, opportunities for potential network attacks are nearly unlimited. An additional problem is that many low-cost devices are not equipped with effective security protection so that they are easily hacked and applied within a network of bots (botnet) to perform distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel intrusion detection system (IDS) based on deep learning that aims to identify suspicious behavior in modern heterogeneous information systems. The proposed approach is based on a deep recurrent autoencoder that learns time series of normal network behavior and detects notable network anomalies. An additional feature of the proposed IDS is that it is trained with an optimized dataset, where the number of features is reduced by 94% without classification accuracy loss. Thus, the proposed IDS remains stable in response to slight system perturbations, which do not represent network anomalies. The proposed approach is evaluated under different simulation scenarios and provides a 99% detection accuracy over known datasets while reducing the training time by an order of magnitude. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

abstract={In recent years, ensuring the stability of the huge volume of data generated by billions of users has become the main concern in the field of cyber security. Network security is an extensive part of the cyber security system where intrusions are the leading threat in its way of defense. As a countermeasure to such intrusions in the network, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have played a major role over the years. Although countless works have already been carried out in this field, most of these works have lagged at some points, considering the scope of exploration through recent extensions. So in this paper, a network anomaly detection model, SPIDER, has been proposed. The SPIDER model combines four updated versions of conventional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), namely Bi-LSTM (Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory), LSTM (Long Short Term Memory), Bi-GRU (Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit), and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit). To deal with the dimensionality problems, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been adapted to reduce the data dimensions. The performance of the proposed SPIDER model has been evaluated using the well-known NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets to ensure its robustness. When compared to the corresponding values of different models, the proposed model shows a significant improvement in detecting intrusions over existing models. © 2022 The Author(s)},

abstract={While anomaly detection and the related concept of intrusion detection are widely studied, detecting anomalies in new operating behavior in environments such as the Internet of Things (IoT) is an active field of research. Anomaly detection models trained on datasets that are likely imbalanced have poor results, but the ability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to emulate complex high-dimensional distributions seen in real-world data suggests that they can be effective for anomaly detection. This paper proposes a novel framework for detecting anomalies in IoT networks utilizing conditional GANs (cGANs) to build realistic distributions for a given feature set to overcome the issue of data imbalance. To this end, a one class cGAN (ocGAN) model was utilized to learn the minority data class to balance the dataset. Then, the binary class cGAN (bcGAN) model generates augmented data for the binary balance dataset. The performance of the ocGAN and bcGAN models in binary and multiclass classification environments were evaluated using a Feed Forward Neural Network (FFN) and tested on two network-based anomaly detection datasets and five IoT network-based anomaly detection datasets. The proposed models outperformed other anomaly detection models in the standard metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The use of deep learning in various models is a powerful tool in detecting Internet of Things (IoT) attacks and identifying new types of intrusion to access a better secure network. The need to develop an intrusion detection system to detect and classify attacks in an appropriate time and automated manner increases particularly because of the use of IoT and the nature of its data that causes an increase in attacks. Malicious attacks are continuously changing, causing new attacks. In this study, we present a survey about the detection of anomalies and detect intrusion by distinguishing between normal and malicious behaviors whilst analyzing network traffic to discover new attacks. This study surveys previous research by evaluating their performance through two categories of new datasets of real traffic (i.e. CSE-CIC-IDS2018 and Bot-IoT datasets). To evaluate the performance, we show accuracy measurement for detect intrusion in different systems. © 2022 Iraqi Journal for Computer Science and Mathematics. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Detecting attacks to Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) is of utmost importance, due to their increasingly frequent use in many critical assets. Intrusion detection in CPSs and other domains, such as the Internet of Things, is often addressed through machine and deep learning. However, many existing proposals tend to favor the application of complex detection models over the usability in real-world operations. This paper presents CPS-GUARD, a novel intrusion detection approach based on a single semi-supervised autoencoder and a technique to set the threshold used to discriminate normal operations from attacks. The technique is outlier-aware, in that it relies on outlier detection to mitigate inherent imperfections of the training data. CPS-GUARD is evaluated by means of direct experiments with normal and intrusion data points pertaining to individual sensing devices, an HTTP server and four full-fledged systems, including CPSs. Experiments are based on a wide spectrum of attacks available in six state-of-the-art datasets. The intrusion detection results of CPS-GUARD are within 0.949-1.000 recall, 0.961-0.999 precision and 0.006-0.027 false positive rate depending on the specific system. The results are competitive with other existing intrusion detection methods. The evaluation is complemented by a comparative study on alternative threshold selection and outlier detection techniques. © 2023},

abstract={Cyber-attacks pose increasing challenges in precisely detecting intrusions, risking data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This review paper presents recent IDS taxonomy, a comprehensive review of intrusion detection techniques, and commonly used datasets for evaluation. It discusses evasion techniques employed by attackers and the challenges in combating them to enhance network security. Researchers strive to improve IDS by accurately detecting intruders, reducing false positives, and identifying new threats. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques are adopted in IDS systems, showing potential in efficiently detecting intruders across networks. The paper explores the latest trends and advancements in ML and DL-based network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), including methodology, evaluation metrics, and dataset selection. It emphasizes research obstacles and proposes a future research model to address weaknesses in the methodologies. The decision tree, known for its speed and user-friendliness, is proposed as a model for detecting result anomalies, combining findings from a comparative survey. This research aims to provide insights into building an effective decision tree-based detection framework. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are the most common tool used to detect malicious attacks on a network. They help prevent the ever-increasing different attacks and provide better security for the network. NIDS are classified into signature-based and anomaly-based detection. The most common type of NIDS is the anomaly-based NIDS which is based on machine learning models and is able to detect attacks with high accuracy. However, in recent years, NIDS has achieved even better results in detecting already known and novel attacks with the adoption of deep learning models. Benchmark datasets in intrusion detection try to simulate real-network traffic by including more normal traffic samples than the attack samples. This causes the training data to be imbalanced and causes difficulties in detecting certain types of attacks for the NIDS. In this paper, a data resampling technique is proposed based on Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN) and Tomek Links algorithms in combination with different deep learning models to mitigate the class imbalance problem. The proposed model is evaluated on the benchmark NSL-KDD dataset using accuracy, precision, recall and F-score metrics. The experimental results show that in binary classification, the proposed method improves the performance of the NIDS and outperforms state-of-the-art models with an achieved accuracy of 99.8%. In multi-class classification, the results were also improved, outperforming state-of-the-art models with an achieved accuracy of 99.98%. © 2023, The Author(s).},

abstract={As Internet of Things (IoT) networks expand globally with an annual increase of active devices, providing better safeguards to threats is becoming more prominent. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is the most viable solution that mitigates the threats of cyberattacks. Given the many constraints of the ever-changing network environment of IoT devices, an effective yet lightweight IDS is required to detect cyber anomalies and categorize various cyberattacks. Additionally, most publicly available datasets used for research do not reflect the recent network behaviors, nor are they made from IoT networks. To address these issues, in this paper, we have the following contri-butions: (1) we create a dataset from IoT networks, namely, the Center for Cyber Defense (CCD) IoT Network Intrusion Dataset V1 (CCD-INID-V1); (2) we propose a hybrid lightweight form of IDS— an embedded model (EM) for feature selection and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for attack detection and classification. The proposed method has two models: (a) RCNN: Random Forest (RF) is combined with CNN and (b) XCNN: eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is combined with CNN. RF and XGBoost are the embedded models to reduce less impactful features. (3) We attempt anomaly (binary) classifications and attack-based (multiclass) classifications on CCD-INID-V1 and two other IoT datasets, the detection_of_IoT_botnet_attacks_N_BaIoT dataset (Balot) and the CIRA-CIC-DoHBrw-2020 dataset (DoH20), to explore the effectiveness of these learning-based security models. Using RCNN, we achieved an Area under the Receiver Characteristic Operator (ROC) Curve (AUC) score of 0.956 with a runtime of 32.28 s on CCD-INID-V1, 0.999 with a runtime of 71.46 s on Balot, and 0.986 with a runtime of 35.45 s on DoH20. Using XCNN, we achieved an AUC score of 0.998 with a runtime of 51.38 s for CCD-INID-V1, 0.999 with a runtime of 72.12 s for Balot, and 0.999 with a runtime of 72.91 s for DoH20. Compared to KNN, XCNN required 86.98% less computational time, and RCNN required 91.74% less computational time to achieve equal or better accurate anomaly detections. We find XCNN and RCNN are consistently efficient and handle scala-bility well; in particular, 1000 times faster than KNN when dealing with a relatively larger dataset-Balot. Finally, we highlight RCNN and XCNN’s ability to accurately detect anomalies with a signif-icant reduction in computational time. This advantage grants flexibility for the IDS placement strat-egy. Our IDS can be placed at a central server as well as resource-constrained edge devices. Our lightweight IDS requires low train time and hence decreases reaction time to zero-day attacks. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Machine learning (ML) algorithms are often used to design effective intrusion detection (ID) systems for appropriate mitigation and effective detection of malicious cyber threats at the host and network levels. However, cybersecurity attacks are still increasing. An ID system can play a vital role in detecting such threats. Existing ID systems are unable to detect malicious threats, primarily because they adopt approaches that are based on traditional ML techniques, which are less concerned with the accurate classication and feature selection. Thus, developing an accurate and intelligent ID system is a priority. The main objective of this study was to develop a hybrid intelligent intrusion detection system (HIIDS) to learn crucial features representation efciently and automatically from massive unlabeled raw network trafc data. Many ID datasets are publicly available to the cybersecurity research community. As such, we used a spark MLlib (machine learning library)-based robust classier, such as logistic regression (LR), extreme gradient boosting (XGB) was used for anomaly detection, and a state-of-the-art DL, such as a long short-term memory autoencoder (LSTMAE) for misuse attack was used to develop an efcient and HIIDS to detect and classify unpredictable attacks. Our approach utilized LSTM to detect temporal features and an AE to more efciently detect global features. Therefore, to evaluate the efcacy of our proposed approach, experiments were conducted on a publicly existing dataset, the contemporary real-life ISCX-UNB dataset. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed spark MLlib and LSTMAE-based HIIDS signicantly outperformed existing ID approaches, achieving a high accuracy rate of up to 97.52% for the ISCX-UNB dataset respectively 10-fold crossvalidation test. It is quite promising to use our proposed HIIDS in real-world circumstances on a large-scale. © 2021 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Anomalies in time series, also called "discord,"are the abnormal subsequences. The occurrence of anomalies in time series may indicate that some faults or disease will occur soon. Therefore, development of novel computational approaches for anomaly detection (discord search) in time series is of great significance for state monitoring and early warning of real-time system. Previous studies show that many algorithms were successfully developed and were used for anomaly classification, e.g., health monitoring, traffic detection, and intrusion detection. However, the anomaly detection of time series was not well studied. In this paper, we proposed a long short-term memory- (LSTM-) based anomaly detection method (LSTMAD) for discord search from univariate time series data. LSTMAD learns the structural features from normal (nonanomalous) training data and then performs anomaly detection via a statistical strategy based on the prediction error for observed data. In our experimental evaluation using public ECG datasets and real-world datasets, LSTMAD detects anomalies more accurately than other existing approaches in comparison. © 2021 Zhiwei Ji et al.},

abstract={The prevalence of internet usage leads to diverse internet traffic, which may contain information about various types of internet attacks. In recent years, many researchers have applied deep learning technology to intrusion detection systems and obtained fairly strong recognition results. However, most experiments have used old datasets, so they could not reflect the latest attack information. In this paper, a current state of the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset and standard evaluation metrics has been employed to evaluate the proposed mechanism. After preprocessing the dataset, six models—deep neural network (DNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), CNN + RNN and CNN + LSTM—were constructed to judge whether network traffic comprised a malicious attack. In addition, multi-classification experiments were conducted to sort traffic into benign traffic and six categories of malicious attacks: BruteForce, Denial-of-service (DoS), Web Attacks, Infiltration, Botnet, and Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS). Each model showed a high accuracy in various experiments, and their multi-class classification accuracy were above 98%. Compared with the intrusion detection system (IDS) of other papers, the proposed model effectively improves the detection performance. Moreover, the inference time for the combinations of CNN + RNN and CNN + LSTM is longer than that of the individual DNN, RNN and CNN. Therefore, the DNN, RNN and CNN are better than CNN + RNN and CNN + LSTM for considering the implementation of the algorithm in the IDS device. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have achieved amazing progress in diverse disciplines. One of the most efficient approaches is unsupervised learning (UL), a sort of algorithms for analyzing and clustering unlabeled data; it allows identifying hidden patterns or performing data clustering over provided data without the need for human involvement. There is no prior knowledge of actual abnormalities when using UL methods in anomaly detection (AD); hence, a DL-intrusion detection system (IDS)-based on AD depends intensely on their assumption about the distribution of anomalies. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised AD Host-IDS for internet of things (IoT) based on adversarial training architecture using the generative adversarial network (GAN). Our proposed IDS, called "EdgeIDS", targets mostly IoT devices because of their limited functionality; IoT devices send and receive only specific data, not like traditional devices, such as servers or computers that exchange a wide range of data. We benchmarked our proposed "EdgeIDS" on the message queuing telemetry transport (MQTTset) dataset with five attack types, and our obtained results are promising, up to 0.99 in the ROC-AUC metric, and to just 0.035 in the ROC-EER metric. Our proposed technique could be a solution for detecting cyber abnormalities in the IoT. © 2022 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The tremendous number of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, with their ubiquity, has provided us with unprecedented productivity and simplified our daily life. At the same time, the insecurity of these technologies ensures that our daily lives are surrounded by vulnerable computers, allowing for the launch of multiple attacks via large-scale botnets through the IoT. These attacks have been successful in achieving their heinous objectives. A strong identification strategy is essential to keep devices secured. This paper proposes and implements a model for anomaly-based intrusion detection in IoT networks that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) to detect and classify binary and multiclass IoT network data. The proposed model is validated using the BoT-IoT, IoT Network Intrusion, MQTT-IoT-IDS2020, and IoT-23 intrusion detection datasets. Our proposed binary and multiclass classification model achieved an exceptionally high level of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. © 2021 by the authors.},

Day after day, attacks evolve and new attacks are emerged. Hence, network anomaly-based intrusion detection system is become very important, which plays an important role in protecting the network through early detection of attacks. Because of the development in machine learning and the emergence of deep learning field, and its ability to extract high-level features with high accuracy, these systems have been included to work with real network traffic CSE-CIC-IDS2018 for a wide range of intrusions and normal behavior as an ideal method of testing and evaluation.

abstract={Anomaly detection is one of the biggest issues of security in the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) due to the increase in cyber attack dangers for distributed devices and critical infrastructure networks. To face these challenges, the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is suggested as a robust mechanism to protect and monitor malicious activities in IIoT networks. In this work, we suggest a new mechanism to improve the efficiency and robustness of the IDS system using Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We aim to develop realistic and equilibrated distribution for a given feature set using artificial data in order to overcome the issue of data imbalance. We show how the GAN can efficiently assist the distributional RL-based-IDS in enhancing the detection of minority attacks. To assess the taxonomy of our approach, we verified the effectiveness of our algorithm by using the Distributed Smart Space Orchestration System (DS2OS) dataset. The performance of the normal DRL and DRL-GAN models in binary and multiclass classifications was evaluated based on anomaly detection datasets. The proposed models outperformed the normal DRL in the standard metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We demonstrated that the GAN introduced in the training process of DRL with the aim of improving the detection of a specific class of data achieves the best results. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={IoT (Internet of Things) usage in industrial and scientific domains is progressively increasing. Currently, IoTs are utilized in numerous applications in different domains, similar to communication technology, environmental monitoring, agriculture, medical services, and manufacturing purposes. But, the IoT systems are vulnerable against various intrusions and attacks in the perspective on the security view. It is essential to create an intrusion detection model to detect and secure the network from different attacks and anomalies that continually happen in the network. In this paper, the anomaly detection model for an IoT network using deep neural networks (DNN) with chicken swarm optimization (CSO) algorithm was proposed. Presently, the DNN has demonstrated its efficiency in different fields that are applicable to its usage. Deep learning is the type of algorithm based on machine learning which used many layers to gradually extricate more significant features of level from the raw inputs. The UNSW-NB15 dataset was utilized to evaluate the anomaly detection model. The proposed model obtained 94.85% accuracy and 96.53% detection rate which is better than other compared techniques like GA-NB, GSO, and PSO for validation. The DNN-CSO model has performed well in detecting most of the attacks, and it is appropriate for detecting anomalies in the IoT network. © 2022 Rashmita Khilar et al.},

abstract={Several sectors have embraced Cloud Computing (CC) due to its inherent characteristics, such as scalability and flexibility. However, despite these advantages, security concerns remain a significant challenge for cloud providers. CC introduces new vulnerabilities, including unauthorized access, data breaches, and insider threats. The shared infrastructure of cloud systems makes them attractive targets for attackers. The integration of robust security mechanisms becomes crucial to address these security challenges. One such mechanism is an Intrusion Detection System (IDS), which is fundamental in safeguarding networks and cloud environments. An IDS monitors network traffic and system activities. In recent years, researchers have explored the use of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches to enhance the performance of IDS. ML and DL algorithms have demonstrated their ability to analyze large volumes of data and make accurate predictions. By leveraging these techniques, IDSs can adapt to evolving threats, detect previous attacks, and reduce false positives. This article proposes a novel IDS model based on DL algorithms like the Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) and Random Forest (RF). The RF classifier is used for feature selection, and the RBFNN algorithm is used to detect intrusion in CC environments. Moreover, the datasets Bot-IoT and NSL-KDD have been utilized to validate our suggested approach. To evaluate the impact of our approach on an imbalanced dataset, we relied on Matthew’s Correlation Coefficient (MCC) as a normalized measure. Our method achieves accuracy (ACC) higher than 92% using the minimum features, and we managed to increase the MCC from 28% to 93%. The contributions of this study are twofold. Firstly, it presents a novel IDS model that leverages DL algorithms, demonstrating an improved ACC higher than 92% using minimal features and a substantial increase in MCC from 28% to 93%. Secondly, it addresses the security challenges specific to CC environments, offering a promising solution to enhance security in cloud systems. By integrating the proposed IDS model into cloud environments, cloud providers can benefit from enhanced security measures, effectively mitigating unauthorized access and potential data breaches. The utilization of DL algorithms, RBFNN, and RF has shown remarkable potential in detecting intrusions and strengthening the overall security posture of CC. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={Cyberattacks represent an ever-growing threat that has become a real priority for most organizations. Attackers use sophisticated attack scenarios to deceive defense systems in order to access private data or cause harm. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) have demonstrate impressive results for detecting cyberattacks due to their ability to learn generalizable patterns from flat data. However, flat data fail to capture the structural behavior of attacks, which is essential for effective detection. Contrarily, graph structures provide a more robust and abstract view of a system that is difficult for attackers to evade. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become successful in learning useful representations from the semantic provided by graph-structured data. Intrusions have been detected for years using graphs such as network flow graphs or provenance graphs, and learning representations from these structures can help models understand the structural patterns of attacks, in addition to traditional features. In this survey, we focus on the applications of graph representation learning to the detection of network-based and host-based intrusions, with special attention to GNN methods. For both network and host levels, we present the graph data structures that can be leveraged and we comprehensively review the state-of-the-art papers along with the used datasets. Our analysis reveals that GNNs are particularly efficient in cybersecurity, since they can learn effective representations without requiring any external domain knowledge. We also evaluate the robustness of these techniques based on adversarial attacks. Finally, we discuss the strengths and weaknesses of GNN-based intrusion detection and identify future research directions. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Detection of intrusions is a system that is competent in detecting cyber-attacks and network anomalies. A variety of strategies have been developed for IDS so far. However, there are factors that they lack in performance, creating scope for further research. The current trend shows that the Deep Learning (DL) technique has been proven better than traditional techniques for IDS. Throughout these studies, we presented a hybrid model that is a Deep Learning method called Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network using Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Unit. Through simulations on the public dataset CICIDS2017, we have shown the model’s effectiveness. It has been noted that the suggested model successfully predicted most of the network attacks with 99.13% classification accuracy. The proposed model outperformed the Naïve Bayes classifier in terms of prediction accuracy and False Positive rate. The suggested model managed to perform well with only 58% attributes of the dataset compared to other existing classifiers. Moreover, this study also demonstrates the performance of LSTM and GRU with RNN independently. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={Anomaly detection in network traffic is one of the key techniques to ensure security in future networks. Today, the importance of this topic is even higher, since the network traffic is growing and there is a need to have smart algorithms, which can automatically adapt to new network conditions, detect threats and recognize the type of the possible network attack. Nowadays, there are a lot of different approaches, some of them have reached relatively sufficient accuracy. However, the majority of works are being tested on old datasets, which do not reflect current network conditions and it leads to overfitted results. This is caused by high redundancy of the data and because they fail to reflect the performance of the latest methods in the real-world anomaly detection applications. In this work, we applied a couple of new methods based on convolutional neural networks: U-Net based and Temporal convolutional network based for network attack classification. We trained and evaluated methods on the old dataset KDD99 and the modern large-scale one CSE-CIC-IDS2018. According to results, Temporal convolutional network with LSTM has achieved accuracy 92% and 97% on the KDD99 and the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 respectively, the U-Net model has accuracy 93% and 94% on the KDD99 and the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 respectively. Additionally, we utilized the focal loss function in the Temporal convolutional network with Long Short-Term Memory model, which has positive effect on class imbalance in time-series data. We showed, that the Temporal convolutional network in combination with Long Short-Term Memory network and U-Net model can give higher accuracy compared to other network architectures for network traffic classification. In this work we also proved, that methods trained on the old dataset can easily overfit during training and achieve relatively good results on the testing set, but at the same time, these methods are not so successful on more complex and actual data. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Given the recent COVID-19 situation, many organizations and companies have asked their employees to work from home by connecting to their on-premises servers. This situation may continue a much more extended period in the future, thereby opening more threats to confidentiality and security to the information available in the organizations. It becomes of hell of a task for network administrators to counter the threats. Intrusion Detection Systems are deployed in firewalls to identify attacks or threats. In preset modern technologies, Network Intrusion Detection System plays a significant role in defense of the network threat. Statistical or pattern-based algorithms are used in NIDS to detect the benign activities that are taking place in the network. In this work, deep learning algorithms have developed in NIDS predictive models to detect anomalies and threats automatically. Performance of the proposed model assessed on the NSL-KDD dataset in the view of metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score. The experimental results show that the proposed deep learning model outperforms when compared with existing shallow models. © 2020 Lavoisier. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence have been widely utilised in the security domain, including but not limited to intrusion detection techniques. With the large training datasets of modern traffic, intelligent algorithms and powerful machine learning tools, security researchers have been able to greatly improve on the intrusion detection models and enhance their ability to detect malicious traffic more accurately. Nonetheless, the problem of detecting completely unknown security attacks is still an open area of research. The enormous number of newly developed attacks constitutes an eccentric challenge for all types of intrusion detection systems. Additionally, the lack of a standard definition of what constitutes an unknown security attack in the literature and the industry alike adds to the problem. In this paper, the researchers reviewed the studies on detecting unknown attacks over the past 10 years and found that they tended to use inconsistent definitions. This formulates the need for a standard consistent definition to have comparable results. The researchers proposed a new categorisation of two types of unknown attacks, namely Type-A, which represents a completely new category of unknown attacks, and Type-B, which represents unknown attacks within already known categories of attacks. The researchers conducted several experiments and evaluated modern intrusion detection systems based on shallow and deep artificial neural network models and their ability to detect Type-A and Type-B attacks using two well-known benchmark datasets for network intrusion detection. The research problem was studied as both a binary and multi-class classification problem. The results showed that the evaluated models had poor overall generalisation error measures, where the classification error rate in detecting several types of unknown attacks from 92 experiments was 50.09%, which highlights the need for new approaches and techniques to address this problem. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={It is increasingly difficult to identify complex cyberattacks in a wide range of industries, such as the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). The IoV is a network of vehicles that consists of sensors, actuators, network layers, and communication systems between vehicles. Communication plays an important role as an essential part of the IoV. Vehicles in a network share and deliver information based on several protocols. Due to wireless communication between vehicles, the whole network can be sensitive towards cyber-attacks.In these attacks, sensitive information can be shared with a malicious network or a bogus user, resulting in malicious attacks on the IoV. For the last few years, detecting attacks in the IoV has been a challenging task. It is becoming increasingly difficult for traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) to detect these newer, more sophisticated attacks, which employ unusual patterns. Attackers disguise themselves as typical users to evade detection. These problems can be solved using deep learning. Many machine-learning and deep-learning (DL) models have been implemented to detect malicious attacks; however, feature selection remains a core issue. Through the use of training empirical data, DL independently defines intrusion features. We built a DL-based intrusion model that focuses on Denial of Service (DoS) assaults in particular. We used K-Means clustering for feature scoring and ranking. After extracting the best features for anomaly detection, we applied a novel model, i.e., an Explainable Neural Network (xNN), to classify attacks in the CICIDS2019 dataset and UNSW-NB15 dataset separately. The model performed well regarding the precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy. Comparatively, it can be seen that our proposed model xNN performed well after the feature-scoring technique. In dataset 1 (UNSW-NB15), xNN performed well, with the highest accuracy of 99.7%, while CNN scored 87%, LSTM scored 90%, and the Deep Neural Network (DNN) scored 92%. xNN achieved the highest accuracy of 99.3% while classifying attacks in the second dataset (CICIDS2019); the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) achieved 87%, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) achieved 89%, and the DNN achieved 82%. The suggested solution outperformed the existing systems in terms of the detection and classification accuracy. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Digital systems are changing to security systems in contemporary days. It is time for the digital system to have sufficient security to defend against threats and attacks. The intrusion detection system can identify an anomaly from an external or internal source in the network system. Many kinds of threats are present, that is, active and passive. These dangers could lead to anomalies in the system by which data can be attacked and taken by attackers from the beginning to the destination. Machine learning nowadays is a developing topic; its applications are wide. We can forecast the future through machine learning and classify the right class. In this paper, we employed the new binary and multiclass classification model of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify the anomaly of the network system. In this respect, we used the NSLKDD dataset. Our model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to conduct binary and multiclass classification. In both datasets, we build a DL-based DoS detection model. We focus on the DoS category in the most extensively used IDS dataset, KDD. As the name implies, CNN is the most extensively used the DL model for image recognition. Adding a pooling layer to the convolution layer minimizes the size of the feature data extracted from the image while maintaining I/O and spatial information. The CNN model has shown the promising results of multiclass and binary classification in terms of validation loss of 0.0012 at 11th epochs and validation accuracy of 98% and 99%, respectively. © 2021 Muhammad Shoaib Akhtar and Tao Feng.},

abstract={The development of an optimized deep learning intruder detection model that could be executed on IoT devices with limited hardware support has several advantages, such as the reduction of communication energy, lowering latency, and protecting data privacy. Motivated by these benefits, this research aims to design a lightweight autoencoder deep model that has a shallow architecture with a small number of input features and a few hidden neurons. To achieve this objective, an efficient two-layer optimizer is used to evolve a lightweight deep autoencoder model by performing simultaneous selection for the input features, the training instances, and the number of hidden neurons. The optimized deep model is constructed guided by both the accuracy of a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier and the complexity of the autoencoder model. To evaluate the performance of the proposed optimized model, it has been applied for the N-baiot intrusion detection dataset. Reported results showed that the proposed model achieved anomaly detection accuracy of 99%with a lightweight autoencoder model with on average input features around 30 and output hidden neurons of 2 only. In addition, the proposed two-layers optimizer was able to outperform several optimizers such as Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Reinforcement Learning-based Memetic Particle Swarm Optimization (RLMPSO). © 2022 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

abstract={Due to the increasing cyber-attacks, various Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have been proposed to identify network anomalies. Most existing machine learning-based IDSs learn patterns from the features extracted from network traffic flows, and the deep learning-based approaches can learn data distribution features from the raw data to differentiate normal and anomalous network flows. Although having been used in the real world widely, the above methods are vulnerable to some types of attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel attack framework, Anti-Intrusion Detection AutoEncoder (AIDAE), to generate features to disable the IDS. In the proposed framework, an encoder transforms features into a latent space, and multiple decoders reconstruct the continuous and discrete features, respectively. Additionally, a generative adversarial network is used to learn the flexible prior distribution of the latent space. The correlation between continuous and discrete features can be kept by using the proposed training scheme. Experiments conducted on NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICIDS2017 datasets show that the generated features indeed degrade the detection performance of existing IDSs dramatically. © 2020 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications},

abstract={The combination of deep learning and intrusion detection has become a hot topic in today's network security. In the face of massive, high-dimensional network traffic with uneven sample distribution, how to be able to accurately detect anomalous traffic is the primary task of intrusion detection. Most research on intrusion detection systems based on network anomalous traffic detection has focused on supervised learning; however, the process of obtaining labeled data often requires a lot of time and effort, as well as the support of network experts. Therefore, it is worthwhile investigating the development of label-free self-supervised learning-based approaches called BYOL which is a simple and elegant framework with sufficiently powerful feature extraction capabilities for intrusion detection systems. In this paper, we propose a new data augmentation strategy for intrusion detection data and an intrusion detection model based on label-free self-supervised learning, using a new data augmentation strategy to introduce a perturbation enhancement model to learn invariant feature representation capability and an improved BYOL self-supervised learning method to train the UNSW-NB15 intrusion detection dataset without labels to extract network traffic feature representations. Linear evaluation on UNSW-NB15 and transfer learning on NSK-KDD, KDD CUP99, CIC IDS2017, and CIDDS_001 achieve excellent performance in all metrics. © 2021 Zhendong Wang et al.},

abstract={Regarding to the computer system security, the intrusion detection systems are fundamental components for discriminating attacks at the early stage. They monitor and analyze network traffics, looking for abnormal behaviors or attack signatures to detect intrusions in early time. However, many challenges arise while developing flexible and efficient network intrusion detection system (NIDS) for unforeseen attacks with high detection rate. In this paper, deep neural network (DNN) approach was proposed for anomaly detection NIDS. Dropout is the regularized technique used with DNN model to reduce the overfitting. The experimental results applied on NSL_KDD dataset. SoftMax output layer has been used with cross entropy loss function to enforce the proposed model in multiple classification, including five labels, one is normal and four others are attacks (Dos, R2L, U2L and Probe). Accuracy metric was used to evaluate the model performance. The proposed model accuracy achieved to 99.45%. Commonly the recognition time is reduced in the NIDS by using feature selection technique. The proposed DNN classifier implemented with feature selection algorithm, and obtained on accuracy reached to 99.27%. © 2020 University of Baghdad. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The significant development of Internet applications over the past 10 years has resulted in the rising necessity for the information network to be secured. An intrusion detection system is a fundamental network infrastructure defense that must be able to adapt to the ever-evolving threat landscape and identify new attacks that have low false alarm. Researchers have developed several supervised as well as unsupervised methods from the data mining and machine learning disciplines so that anomalies can be detected reliably. As an aspect of machine learning, deep learning uses a neuron-like structure to learn tasks. A successful deep learning technique method is convolution neural network (CNN); however, it is presently not suitable to detect anomalies. It is easier to identify expected contents within the input flow in CNNs, whereas there are minor differences in the abnormalities compared to the normal content. This suggests that a particular method is required for identifying such minor changes. It is expected that CNNs would learn the features that form the characteristic of the content of an image (flow) rather than variations that are unrelated to the content. Hence, this study recommends a new CNN architecture type known as mean convolution layer (CNN-MCL) that was developed for learning the anomalies' content features and then identifying the particular abnormality. The recommended CNN-MCL helps in designing a strong network intrusion detection system that includes an innovative form of convolutional layer that can teach low-level abnormal characteristics. It was observed that assessing the proposed model on the CICIDS2017 dataset led to favorable results in terms of real-world application regarding detecting anomalies that are highly accurate and have low false-alarm rate as opposed to other best models. © 2020 Leila Mohammadpour et al.},

abstract={Oil and Gas organizations are dependent on their IT infrastructure, which is a small part of their industrial automation infrastructure, to function effectively. The oil and gas (O&G) organizations industrial automation infrastructure landscape is complex. To perform focused and effective studies, Industrial systems infrastructure is divided into functional levels by The Instrumentation, Systems and Automation Society (ISA) Standard ANSI/ISA-95:2005. This research focuses on the ISA-95:2005 level-4 IT infrastructure to address network anomaly detection problem for ensuring the security and reliability of Oil and Gas resource planning, process planning and operations management. Anomaly detectors try to recognize patterns of anomalous behaviors from network traffic and their performance is heavily dependent on extraction time and quality of network traffic features or representations used to train the detector. Creating efficient representations from large volumes of network traffic to develop anomaly detection models is a time and resource intensive task. In this study we propose, implement and evaluate use of Deep learning to learn effective Network data representations from raw network traffic to develop data driven anomaly detection systems. Proposed methodology provides an automated and cost effective replacement of feature extraction which is otherwise a time and resource intensive task for developing data driven anomaly detectors. The ISCX-2012 dataset is used to represent ISA-95 level-4 network traffic because the O&G network traffic at this level is not much different than normal internet traffic. We trained four representation learning models using popular deep neural network architectures to extract deep representations from ISCX 2012 traffic flows. A total of sixty anomaly detectors were trained by authors using twelve conventional Machine Learning algorithms to compare the performance of aforementioned deep representations with that of a human-engineered handcrafted network data representation. The comparisons were performed using well known model evaluation parameters. Results showed that deep representations are a promising feature in engineering replacement to develop anomaly detection models for IT infrastructure security. In our future research, we intend to investigate the effectiveness of deep representations, extracted using ISA-95:2005 Level 2-3 traffic comprising of SCADA systems, for anomaly detection in critical O&G systems. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Industrial control systems (ICSs) for critical infrastructure are extensively utilized to provide the fundamental functions of society and are frequently employed in critical infrastructure. Therefore, security of these systems from cyberattacks is essential. Over the years, several proposals have been made for various types of cyberattack detection systems, with each concept using a distinct set of processes and methodologies. However, there is a substantial void in the literature regarding approaches for detecting cyberattacks in ICSs. Identifying cyberattacks in ICSs is the primary aim of this proposed research. Anomaly detection in ICSs based on an artificial intelligence algorithm is presented. The methodology is intended to serve as a guideline for future research in this area. On the one hand, machine learning includes logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and decision tree (DT) algorithms, deep learning long short-term memory (LSTM), and the convolution neural network and long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) network to detect ICS malicious attacks. The proposed algorithms were examined using real ICS datasets from the industrial partners Necon Automation and International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM). There were three types of attacks: man-in-the-middle (mitm) attack, web-server access attack, and telnet attack, as well as normal. The proposed system was developed in two stages: binary classification and multiclass classification. The binary classification detected the malware as normal or attacks and the multiclass classification was used for detecting all individual attacks. The KNN and DT algorithms achieved superior accuracy (100%) in binary classification and multiclass classification. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis method was presented to predict the error between the target and prediction values. The sensitivity analysis results showed that the KNN and DT algorithms achieved R2 = 100% in both stages. The obtained results were compared with existing systems; the proposed algorithms outperformed existing systems. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Anomaly-based In-Vehicle Intrusion Detection System (IV-IDS) is one of the protection mechanisms to detect cyber attacks on automotive vehicles. Using artificial intelligence (AI) for anomaly detection to thwart cyber attacks is promising but suffers from generating false alarms and making decisions that are hard to interpret. Consequently, this issue leads to uncertainty and distrust towards such IDS design unless it can explain its behavior, e.g., by using eXplainable AI (XAI). In this paper, we consider the XAI-powered design of such an IV-IDS using CAN bus data from a public dataset, named 'Survival'. Novel features are engineered, and a Deep Neural Network (DNN) is trained over the dataset. A visualization-based explanation, 'VisExp', is created to explain the behavior of the AI-based IV-IDS, which is evaluated by experts in a survey, in relation to a rule-based explanation. Our results show that experts' trust in the AI-based IV-IDS is significantly increased when they are provided with VisExp (more so than the rule-based explanation). These findings confirm the effect, and by extension the need, of explainability in automated systems, and VisExp, being a source of increased explainability, shows promise in helping involved parties gain trust in such systems. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={An intrusion detection system, often known as an IDS, is extremely important for preventing attacks on a network, violating network policies, and gaining unauthorized access to a network. The effectiveness of IDS is highly dependent on data preprocessing techniques and classification models used to enhance accuracy and reduce model training and testing time. For the purpose of anomaly identification, researchers have developed several machine learning and deep learning-based algorithms; nonetheless, accurate anomaly detection with low test and train times remains a challenge. Using a hybrid feature selection approach and a deep neural network- (DNN-) based classifier, the authors of this research suggest an enhanced intrusion detection system (IDS). In order to construct a subset of reduced and optimal features that may be used for classification, a hybrid feature selection model that consists of three methods, namely, chi square, ANOVA, and principal component analysis (PCA), is applied. These methods are referred to as "the big three."On the NSL-KDD dataset, the suggested model receives training and is then evaluated. The proposed method was successful in achieving the following results: a reduction of input data by 40%, an average accuracy of 99.73%, a precision score of 99.75%, an F1 score of 99.72%, and an average training and testing time of 138% and 2.7 seconds, respectively. The findings of the experiments demonstrate that the proposed model is superior to the performance of the other comparison approaches. © 2022 Muhammad Naveed et al.},

abstract={In recent years, the scale of networks has substantially evolved due to the rapid development of infrastructures in real networks. Under the circumstances, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) have become the crucial tool to detect cyberattacks, malicious actions, and anomaly behaviors that threaten the credibility and integrity of information services in networks. The feature selection technologies are commonly applied in various intrusion detection algorithms owing to the potential of improving performance and speeding up decision-making. However, existing feature selection-based intrusion detection methods still suffer from high computational complexity or the lack of robustness. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a novel ensemble feature selection-based deep neural network (EFS-DNN) to detect attacks in networks with high-volume traffic data. In particular, we leverage light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) as the base selector in the ensemble feature selection module to enhance the robustness of the selected optimal subset. Besides, we utilize a deep neural network with batch normalization and embedding technique as the classifier to improve the expressiveness.

abstract={For a long time, the digitization of all aspects of life in current cultures is seen as a procured gain. In any way, the computerized world is noticeably flawed and numerous risks and dangers are present as in the terrestrial land. People's daily life has changed due to the quick and advanced level of improvement in smart cities. The most important problem that needs to be looked upon is citizens' life, security and privacy issues. The use of Deep Learning (DL), a subcategory of Machine learning (ML) has excelled in the field of smart cities. So, the following stages in this paper bring an effective intrusion detection system using deep learning. a) Data collection from standard datasets such as GPRS, CIDDS001, as well as UNSW-NB15 contains various types of attacks, these will be given for b) Preprocessing, for eliminating anomalies using missing value removal, and normalization techniques. Then from those data, quintessential features are extracted using Autoencoder (AE) and then from those several features, d) feature selection for selecting and mostly removing timestamps from attack dataset using Random Forest (RF) and finally for e) prediction with help of Restricted Boltzmann Network (RBN). Experiment evaluation states that proposed model (RF-RBN) performed better over various state-of-art models under various measures (accuracy:0.95, sensitivity:0.96, specificity:0.97, detection rate:0.95). © 2023, Innovative Information Science and Technology Research Group.

abstract={Companies seek to promote a swift digitalization of their business processes and new disruptive features to gain an advantage over their competitors. This often results in a wider attack surface that may be exposed to exploitation from adversaries. As budgets are thin, one of the most popular security solutions CISOs choose to invest in is Network-based Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). As anomaly-based NIDS work over a baseline of normal and expected activity, one of the key areas of development is the training of deep learning classification models robust enough so that, given a different network context, the system is still capable of high rate accuracy for intrusion detection. In this study, we propose an anomaly-based NIDS using a deep learning stacked-LSTM model with a novel pre-processing technique that gives it context-free features and outperforms most related works, obtaining over 99% accuracy over the CICIDS2017 dataset. This system can also be applied to different environments without losing its accuracy due to its basis on context-free features. Moreover, using synthetic network attacks, it has been shown that this NIDS approach can detect specific categories of attacks. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={Aiming at unknown or variant ransomware attack encrypted with SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)/ TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol, a detection framework named TGAN-IDS (Transferred Generating Adversarial Network-Intrusion Detection System) based on dual generative adversarial networks is presented in this paper. In this framework, DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) is adopted to train a generator which has good performance to generate adversarial sample, and is transferred to the generator of TGAN. A pre-training model named PreD is built based on CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), which has good performance to do binary classification, and is transferred to the discriminator of TGAN. The generator and discriminator of TGAN play games in training process until the discriminator has a strong ability to detection unknown attack, and then it is output as an anomaly detector. In order to suppress the deterioration of normal sample detection ability during adversarial training of TGAN, a reconstruction loss function is introduced into the target function of TGAN. Experiments on a mixed dataset which is constructed by CICIDS2017 and other ransomware datasets show comparing with other deep learning network, such as AlexNet, ResNet and DenseNet etc., TGAN-IDS performs well in the indicators of detection accuracy, recall or F1-score etc. Also experiments on KDD99, SWaT and WADI datasets show that TGAN-IDS is suitable for other unencrypted unknown network attack detection. © 2021 IEEE Access.

abstract={A reasonably good network intrusion detection system generally requires a high detection rate and a low false alarm rate in order to predict anomalies more accurately. Older datasets cannot capture the schema of a set of modern attacks; therefore, modelling based on these datasets lacked sufficient generalizability. This paper operates on the UNSW-NB15 Dataset, which is currently one of the best representatives of modern attacks and suggests various models. We discuss various models and conclude our discussion with the model that performs the best using various kinds of evaluation metrics. Alongside modelling, a comprehensive data analysis on the features of the dataset itself using our understanding of correlation, variance, and similar factors for a wider picture is done for better modelling. Furthermore, hypothetical ponderings are discussed for potential network intrusion detection systems, including suggestions on prospective modelling and dataset generation as well. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={The innovation and evolution of hacking methodologies have led to a sharp rise in cyber attacks, highlighting the need for enhanced network security approaches. Network intrusion detection systems based on machine learning are playing a significant role in the domain of network security. However, designing an optimal framework for a network intrusion detection system is an ongoing concern. In this study, an optimal framework for a network intrusion detection system based on image processing is proposed. The framework is a fusion of augmented feature selection flow with an image transformation and enhancement methodology. Initially, the proposed framework reduces the number of features to achieve overall efficiency. Later, the non-image data is transformed into images. The transformed images are then enhanced for achieving effective anomaly detection based on a deep-learning classifier. The proposed method is implemented on three diverse benchmark datasets of intrusion detection. To illustrate the efficiency of the proposed framework it is compared with some of the most recent publications on image-processing-based network intrusion detection systems. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Intrusion and malware detection tasks on a host level are a critical part of the overall information security infrastructure of a modern enterprise. While classical host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS) and antivirus (AV) approaches are based on change monitoring of critical files and malware signatures, respectively, some recent research, utilizing relatively vanilla deep learning (DL) methods, has demonstrated promising anomaly-based detection results that already have practical applicability due low false positive rate (FPR). More complex DL methods typically provide better results in natural language processing and image recognition tasks. In this paper, we analyze applicability of more complex dual-flow DL methods, such as long short-term memory fully convolutional network (LSTM-FCN), gated recurrent unit (GRU)-FCN, and several others, for the task specified on the attack-caused Windows OS system calls traces dataset (AWSCTD) and compare it with vanilla single-flow convolutional neural network (CNN) models. The results obtained do not demonstrate any advantages of dual-flow models while processing univariate times series data and introducing unnecessary level of complexity, increasing training, and anomaly detection time, which is crucial in the intrusion containment process. On the other hand, the newly tested AWSCTD-CNN-static (S) single-flow model demonstrated three times better training and testing times, preserving the high detection accuracy. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={Given the continually rising frequency of cyberattacks, the adoption of artificial intelligence methods, particularly Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Reinforcement Learning (RL), has become essential in the realm of cybersecurity. These techniques have proven to be effective in detecting and mitigating cyberattacks, which can cause significant harm to individuals, organizations, and even countries. Machine learning algorithms use statistical methods to identify patterns and anomalies in large datasets, enabling security analysts to detect previously unknown threats. Deep learning, a subfield of ML, has shown great potential in improving the accuracy and efficiency of cybersecurity systems, particularly in image and speech recognition. On the other hand, RL is again a subfield of machine learning that trains algorithms to learn through trial and error, making it particularly effective in dynamic environments. We also evaluated the usage of ChatGPT-like AI tools in cyber-related problem domains on both sides, positive and negative. This article provides an overview of how ML, DL, and RL are applied in cybersecurity, including their usage in malware detection, intrusion detection, vulnerability assessment, and other areas. The paper also specifies several research questions to provide a more comprehensive framework to investigate the efficiency of AI and ML models in the cybersecurity domain. The state-of-the-art studies using ML, DL, and RL models are evaluated in each Section based on the main idea, techniques, and important findings. It also discusses these techniques' challenges and limitations, including data quality, interpretability, and adversarial attacks. Overall, the use of ML, DL, and RL in cybersecurity holds great promise for improving the effectiveness of security systems and enhancing our ability to protect against cyberattacks. Therefore, it is essential to continue developing and refining these techniques to address the ever-evolving nature of cyber threats. Besides, some promising solutions that rely on machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning are susceptible to adversarial attacks, underscoring the importance of factoring in this vulnerability when devising countermeasures against sophisticated cyber threats. We also concluded that ChatGPT can be a valuable tool for cybersecurity, but it should be noted that ChatGPT-like tools can also be manipulated to threaten the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Machine learning (ML)-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs) can classify each network’s flow behavior as benign or malicious by detecting heterogeneous features, including both categorical and numerical features. However, the present ML-based NIDSs are deemed insufficient in terms of their ability to generalize, particularly in changing network environments such as the Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart home. Although IoT devices add so much to home comforts, they also introduce potential risks and vulnerabilities. Recently, many NIDS studies on other IoT scenarios, such as the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) and smart cities, focus on utilizing the telemetry data of IoT devices for IoT intrusion detection. Because when IoT devices are under attack, their abnormal telemetry data values can reflect the anomaly state of those devices. Those telemetry data-based IoT NIDS methods detect intrusion events from a different view, focusing on the attack impact, from the traditional network traffic-based NIDS, which focuses on analyzing attack behavior. The telemetry data-based NIDS is more suitable for IoT devices without built-in security mechanisms. Considering the smart home IoT scenario, which has a smaller scope and a limited number of IoT devices compared to other IoT scenarios, both NIDS views can work independently. This motivated us to propose a novel ML-based NIDS to combine the network traffic-based and telemetry data-based NIDS together. In this paper, we propose a Transformer-based IoT NIDS method to learn the behaviors and effects of attacks from different types of data that are generated in the heterogeneous IoT environment. The proposed method utilizes a self-attention mechanism to learn contextual embeddings for input network features. Based on the contextual embeddings, our method can solve the feature set challenge, including both continuous and categorical features. Our method is the first to utilize both network traffic data and IoT sensors’ telemetry data at the same time for intrusion detection. Experiments reveal the effectiveness of our method on a realistic network traffic intrusion detection dataset named ToN_IoT, with an accuracy of 97.95% for binary classification and 95.78% for multiple classifications on pure network data. With the extra IoT information, the performance of our method has been improved to 98.39% and 97.06%, respectively. A comparative study with existing works shows that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the ToN_IoT dataset. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={The traditional support vector machine (SVM) requires manual feature extraction to improve classification performance and relies on the expressive power of manually extracted features. However, this characteristic poses limitations in complex Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments. Traditional manual feature extraction may fail to capture all relevant information, thereby restricting the application effectiveness of SVM in IIoT settings. CNN-RNN, as a deep learning network capable of simultaneously extracting spatial and temporal features, can alleviate researchers' burden. In this paper, we propose a novel intrusion detection system (IDS) framework based on anomalies, called CRSF. The framework's pre-training part employs a dimension transformation function to process input data into two-dimensional images. Two-dimensional convolutional kernels are then employed to extract spatial features, and the feature sequences are passed to an RNN to capture richer temporal features. After sufficient pre-training, SVM is used as a classifier to map the pre-training data from the feature space to a high-dimensional space and learn nonlinear decision boundaries, enabling the framework to accurately differentiate feature representations of different classes. Simulation experiments on the TON-IoT-Datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the CRSF framework in intrusion detection. When using the 'linear' kernel function in SVM, the framework achieves an accuracy, F1-score, and AUC of 0.9959, 0.9959, and 0.9977, respectively, indicating its capability and superiority in intrusion detection. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) have a great interest these days to discover complex attack events and protect the critical infrastructures of the Internet of Things (IoT) networks. Existing IDSs based on shallow and deep network architectures demand high computational resources and high volumes of data to establish an adaptive detection engine that discovers new families of attacks from the edge of IoT networks. However, attackers exploit network gateways at the edge using new attacking scenarios (i.e., zero-day attacks), such as ransomware and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. This paper proposes new IDS based on Few-Shot Deep Learning, named CNN-IDS, which can automatically identify zero-day attacks from the edge of a network and protect its IoT systems. The proposed system comprises two-methodological stages: 1) a filtered Information Gain method is to select themost useful features fromnetwork data, and 2) one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm is to recognize new attack types from a network s edge. The proposed model is trained and validated using two datasets of theUNSW-NB15 and Bot-IoT. The experimental results showed that it enhances about a 3% detection rate and around a 3% 4% falsepositive rate with the UNSW-NB15 dataset and about an 8% detection rate using the BoT-IoT dataset. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

abstract={Ensuring the security of critical Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems is of utmost importance, with a primary focus on identifying cyber-attacks using Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). Deep learning (DL) techniques are frequently utilized in the anomaly detection components of IDSs. However, these models often generate high false-positive rates, and their decision-making rationale remains opaque, even to experts. Gaining insights into the reasons behind an IDS's decision to block a specific packet can aid cybersecurity professionals in assessing the system's effectiveness and creating more cyber-resilient solutions. In this paper, we offer an explainable ensemble DL-based IDS to improve the transparency and robustness of DL-based IDSs in IIoT networks. The framework incorporates Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) and Local comprehensible-independent Clarifications (LIME) methods to elucidate the decisions made by DL-based IDSs, providing valuable insights to experts responsible for maintaining IIoT network security and developing more cyber-resilient systems. The ToN_IoT dataset was used to evaluate the efficacy of the suggested framework. As a baseline intrusion detection system, the extreme learning machines (ELM) model was implemented and compared with other models. Experiments show the effectiveness of ensemble learning to improve the results. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={With the growing diversity of cyberattacks in recent years, anomaly-based intrusion detection systems that can detect unknown attacks have attracted significant attention. Furthermore, a wide range of studies on anomaly detection using machine learning and deep learning methods have been conducted. However, many machine learning and deep learning-based methods require significant effort to design the detection feature values, extract the feature values from network packets, and acquire the labeled data used for model training. To solve the aforementioned problems, this paper proposes a new model called DOC-IDS, which is an intrusion detection system based on Perera’s deep one-class classification. The DOC-IDS, which comprises a pair of one-dimensional convolutional neural networks and an autoencoder, uses three different loss functions for training. Although, in general, only regular traffic from the computer network subject to detection is used for anomaly detection training, the DOC-IDS also uses multi-class labeled traffic from open datasets for feature extraction. Therefore, by streamlining the classification task on multi-class labeled traffic, we can obtain a feature representation with highly enhanced data discrimination abilities. Simultaneously, we perform variance minimization in the feature space, even on regular traffic, to further improve the model’s ability to discriminate between normal and abnormal traffic. The DOC-IDS is a single deep learning model that can automatically perform feature extraction and anomaly detection. This paper also reports experiments for evaluating the anomaly detection performance of the DOC-IDS. The results suggest that the DOC-IDS offers higher anomaly detection performance while reducing the load resulting from the design and extraction of feature values. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Industrial control systems (ICS) are the backbone for the implementation of cybersecurity solutions. They are susceptible to various attacks, due to openness in connectivity, unauthorized attempts, malicious attacks, use of more commercial off the shelf (COTS) software and hardware, and implementation of Internet protocols (IP) that exposes them to the outside world. Cybersecurity solutions for Information technology (IT) secured with firewalls, intrusion detec-tion/protection systems do nothing much for Operational technology (OT) ICS. An innovative concept of using real operational technology network traffic-based testbed, for cyber-physical system simulation and analysis, is presented. The testbed is equipped with real-time attacks using in-house penetration test tool with reconnaissance, interception, and firmware analysis scenarios. The test cases with different real-time hacking scenarios are implemented with the ICS cyber test kit, and its industrial datasets are captured which can be utilized for Deep packet inspection (DPI). The DPI provides more visibility into the contents of OT network traffic based on OT protocols. The Machine learning (ML) techniques are deployed for cyber-attack detection of datasets from the cyber kit. The performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score are evaluated and cross validated for different ML algorithms for anomaly detection. The decision tree (DT) ML technique is optimized with pruning method which provides an attack detection accuracy of 96.5%. The deep learning (DL) techniques has been used recently for enhanced OT intrusion detection performances. © 2022, Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been incorporated into the majority of people’s everyday lives and places of employment due to the quick development in information technology. Modern agricultural techniques increasingly use the well-known and superior approach of managing a farm known as “smart farming”. Utilizing a variety of information and agricultural technologies, crops are observed for their general health and productivity. This requires monitoring the condition of field crops and looking at many other indicators. The goal of smart agriculture is to reduce the amount of money spent on agricultural inputs while keeping the quality of the final product constant. The Internet of Things (IoT) has made smart agriculture possible through data collection and storage techniques. For example, modern irrigation systems use effective sensor networks to collect field data for the best plant irrigation. Smart agriculture will become more susceptible to cyber-attacks as its reliance on the IoT ecosystem grows, because IoT networks have a large number of nodes but limited resources, which makes security a difficult issue. Hence, it is crucial to have an intrusion detection system (IDS) that can address such challenges. In this manuscript, an IoT-based privacy-preserving anomaly detection model for smart agriculture has been proposed. The motivation behind this work is twofold. Firstly, ensuring data privacy in IoT-based agriculture is of the utmost importance due to the large volumes of sensitive information collected by IoT devices, including on environmental conditions, crop health, and resource utilization data. Secondly, the timely detection of anomalies in smart agriculture systems is critical to enable proactive interventions, such as preventing crop damage, optimizing resource allocation, and ensuring sustainable farming practices. In this paper, we propose a privacy-encoding-based enhanced deep learning framework for the difficulty of data encryption and intrusion detection. In terms of data encoding, a novel method of a sparse capsule-auto encoder (SCAE) is proposed along with feature selection, feature mapping, and feature normalization. An SCAE is used to convert information into a new encrypted format in order to prevent deduction attacks. An attention-based gated recurrent unit neural network model is proposed to detect the intrusion. An AGRU is an advanced version of a GRU which is enhanced by an attention mechanism. In the results section, the proposed model is compared with existing deep learning models using two public datasets. Parameters such as recall, precision, accuracy, and F1-score are considered. The proposed model has accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score of 99.9%, 99.7%, 99.9%, and 99.8%, respectively. The proposed method is compared using a variety of machine learning techniques such as the deep neural network (DNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM). © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={Cyber-attack is one of the most challenging aspects of information technology. After the emergence of the Internet of Things, which is a vast network of sensors, technology started moving towards the Internet of Things (IoT), many IoT based devices interplay in most of the application wings like defence, healthcare, home automation etc., As the technology escalates, it gives an open platform for raiders to hack the network devices. Even though many traditional methods and Machine Learning algorithms are designed hot, still it “Have a Screw Loose” in detecting the cyber-attacks. To “Pull the Plug on” an effective “Intrusion Detection System (IDS)” is designed with “Deep Learning” technique. This research work elucidates the importance in detecting the cyber-attacks as “Anomaly” and “Normal”. Fast Region-Based Convolution Neural Network (Fast R-CNN), a deep convolution network is implemented to develop an efficient and adaptable IDS. After hunting many research papers and articles, “Gradient Boosting” is found to be a powerful optimizer algorithm that gives us a best results when compared to other existing methods. This algorithm uses “Regression” tactics, a statistical technique to predict the continuous target variable that correlates between the variables. To create a structured valid dataset, a stacked model is made by implementing the two most popular dimensionality reduction techniques Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithms. The brainwaves made us to hybridize Fast R-CNN and Gradient Boost Regression (GBR) which reduces the loss function, processing time and boosts the model’s performance. All the above said methods are trained and tested with NIDS dataset V.10 2017. Finally, the “Decision Making” model decides the best result by giving an alert message. Our proposed model attains a high accuracy of 99.5% in detecting the “Cyber Attacks”. The experiment results revealed that the effectiveness of our proposed model surpasses other deep neural network and machine learning techniques which have less accuracy.

abstract={Anomaly-based intrusion detection system have been consistently used in business organizations and military to detect a breach in network by identifying any activity that deviates from the baseline pattern. In this paper, we propose an effective intrusion detection technique to identify and predict the minority attacks with three layers. Here, the first layer utilizes a Weighted Deep Neural Network (WDNN) for identifying the suspicious traffic samples in network and it is passed to the second layer. Layer 2 classifies the traffic samples as normal or majority and minority attacks using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM). Any traffic sample classified as minority attack is sent to Layer 3 that utilizes XGBoost algorithm. Layer 3 classifies the samples into their respective minority attack classes. To boost the detection rate of minority attacks, system employs a One-Sided Selection under-sampling algorithm to remove noisy samples from the majority attack classes. An Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN) oversampling algorithm generates synthetic samples of minority attack classes. To evaluate the system, the datasets namely NSL KDD, CICIDS-2017 and CIDDS 001 dataset are used. The system attained an overall accuracy of 97.94% on NSL KDD dataset, 98.3% on CICIDS-2017 dataset and 97.9% on CIDDS 001 dataset. © 2023},

abstract={Unknown cyber-attacks have appeared constantly. Several anomaly detection techniques based on semi-supervised learning have been proposed to detect these unknown cyber-attacks. Among them, the Denoising Auto-Encoder (DAE) scheme performs better than others in accuracy but is not good enough in precision. This paper proposes a novel two-stage deep learning structure for network flow anomaly detection by combining the models of Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) and DAE. By using supervised anomaly detection with a selection mechanism to assist semi-supervised anomaly detection, the precision and accuracy of the anomaly detection system are improved. In the proposed structure, we first use the GRU model to analyze the network flow and then take the outcome from the Softmax function as a confidence score. When the score is more than or equal to the predefined confidence threshold, the GRU model outputs the flow as a positive result, no matter the flow is classified as normal or abnormal. When the score is less than the confidence threshold, GRU model outputs the flow as a negative result and passes the flow to DAE model for flow classification. DAE then determines a reconstruction error threshold by learning the pattern of normal flows. Accordingly, the flow is normal or abnormal depending on whether it is under or over the reconstruction error threshold. A comparative experiment is performed using NSL-KDD dataset as benchmark. The results revealed that the precision using the proposed scheme is 0.83% better than DAE. The accuracy using the proposed approach is 90.21%, which is better than Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, OneDimensional Convolutional Neural Network, two-stage Auto-Encoder, etc. In addition, the proposed approach is also applied to the environment of software defined network (SDN). By adopting our approach in SDN environment, the precision and F-measure are significantly improved. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={An effective anomaly-based intelligent IDS (AN-Intel-IDS) must detect both known and unknown attacks. Hence, there is a need to train AN-Intel-IDS using dynamically generated, real-time data in an adversarial setting. Unfortunately, the public datasets available to train AN-Intel-IDS are ineluctably static, unrealistic, and prone to obsolescence. Further, the need to protect private data and conceal sensitive data features has limited data sharing, thus encouraging the use of synthetic data for training predictive and intrusion detection models. However, synthetic data can be unrealistic and potentially bias. On the other hand, real-time data are realistic and current; however, it is inherently imbalanced due to the uneven distribution of anomalous and non-anomalous examples. In general, non-anomalous or normal examples are more frequent than anomalous or attack examples, thus leading to skewed distribution. While imbalanced data are commonly predominant in intrusion detection applications, it can lead to inaccurate predictions and degraded performance. Furthermore, the lack of real-time data produces potentially biased models that are less effective in predicting unknown attacks. Therefore, training AN-Intel-IDS using imbalanced and adversarial learning is instrumental to their efficacy and high performance. This paper investigates imbalanced learning and adversarial learning for training AN-Intel-IDS using a qualitative study. It surveys and synthesizes generative-based data augmentation techniques for addressing the uneven data distribution and generative-based adversarial techniques for generating synthetic yet realistic data in an adversarial setting using rapid review, structured reporting, and subgroup analysis. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Host-based Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS) automatically detect events that indicate compromise by adversarial applications. HIDS are generally formulated as analyses of sequences of system events such as bash commands or system calls. Anomaly-based approaches to HIDS leverage models of normal (a.k.a. baseline) system behavior to detect and report abnormal events and have the advantage of being able to detect novel attacks. In this article, we develop a new method for anomaly-based HIDS using deep learning predictions of sequence-to-sequence behavior in system calls. Our proposed method, called the algorithm, aggregates predictions at the application level to detect anomalies. We investigate the use of several deep learning architectures, including WaveNet and several recurrent networks. We show that empowered with deep learning significantly outperforms previous approaches. We train and evaluate our models using an existing dataset, ADFA-LD, and a new dataset of our own construction, PLAID. As deep learning models are black box in nature, we use an alternate approach, allotaxonographs, to characterize and understand differences in baseline vs. attack sequences in HIDS datasets such as PLAID. © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) contains many smart devices that collect, store, communicate, and process data. IoT implementation has performed novel opportunities in industries, environments, businesses, and homes. Anomaly detection (AD) is helpful in IoT platforms that can recognize and prevent potential system failures, decrease downtime, enhance the quality of products and services, and improve overall operational efficacy. AD systems for IoT data contain statistical modelling, deep learning (DL), and machine learning (ML) approaches which detect patterns and anomalies in the data. This article introduces an Improved Bacterial Foraging Optimization with optimum deep learning for Anomaly Detection (IBFO-ODLAD) in the IoT network. The presented IBFO-ODLAD technique performs data normalization using Z-score normalization approach. For the feature selection process, the IBFO-ODLAD technique designs the IBFO algorithm to choose an optimal subset of features. In addition, the IBFO-ODLAD technique uses multiplicative long short term memory (MLSTM) model for intrusion detection and classification process. Furthermore, the Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA) was executed for the optimum hyperparameter selection of the MLSTM model. The experimental outcome of the IBFO-ODLAD method was validated on the UNSW NB-15 dataset and UCI SECOM dataset. The experimental outcomes signified the improved performance of the IBFO-ODLAD algorithm with maximum accuracy of 98.89 % and 98.66 % validated on the UNSW NB-15 dataset and UCI SECOM dataset respectively. © 2023 Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University},

abstract={Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are increasingly deployed in Internet of Things (IoT) systems for applications such as smart transportation, telemedicine, smart health monitoring and fall detection systems for the elderly people. Given that huge amount of data, vital and critical information can be exchanged between the different parts of a WSN, good management and protection schemes are needed to ensure an efficient and secure operation of the WSN. To ensure an efficient management of WSNs, the Software-Defined Wireless Sensor Network (SDWSN) paradigm has been recently introduced in the literature. In the same vein, Intrusion Detection Systems, have been used in the literature to safeguard the security of SDWSN-based IoTs. In this paper, three popular Artificial Intelligence techniques (Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, and Deep Artificial Neural Network) are trained to be deployed as anomaly detectors in IDSs. It is shown that an IDS using the Decision Tree-based anomaly detector yields the best performances metrics both in the binary classification and in the multinomial classification. Additionally, it was found that an IDS using the Naïve Bayes-based anomaly detector was only adapted for binary classification of intrusions in low memory capacity SDWSN-based IoT (e.g., wearable fitness tracker). Moreover, new state-of-the-art accuracy (binary classification) and F-scores (multinomial classification) were achieved by introducing an end-to-end feature engineering scheme aimed at obtaining 118 features from the 41 features of the Network Security Laboratory-Knowledge Discovery in Databases (NSL-KDD) dataset. The state-of-the-art accuracy was pushed to 0.999777 using the Decision Tree-based anomaly detector. Finally, it was found that the Deep Artificial Neural Network should be expected to become the next default anomaly detector in the light of its current performance metrics and the increasing abundance of training data. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={The rise of interconnected devices through wireless networks provides two sides consequences. On one side, it helps many human tasks; on the other hand, the prone wireless medium opens the vulnerable system to be exploited by adversaries. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is one method to inspect the network traffic by leveraging state-of-the-art anomaly detection techniques. Deep learning models have been utilized to distinguish the benign and malicious traffic. However, projecting the tabular data into images before the image classification has been the main challenge of leveraging deep learning for IDS purposes. We propose the novel projection of tabular data into 2-coded color mapping for IDS purposes. The proposed method employs a feature selection method to ensure optimal dimensionality. We examined the different number of attribute subsets to obtain the relationship between the attributes. Furthermore, it takes advantage of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify the Wi-Fi attacks. We evaluate the proposed model using the most common Wi-Fi attacks dataset, Aegean Wi-Fi Intrusion Dataset (AWID2). The proposed method achieved an F1 score of 99.73% and a false positive rate of 0.24%. This study highlights the importance of addressing the mapping procedures from tabular data into grid-based data before deep learning training and validates the effectiveness of CNN to detect multiple types of wireless network attacks. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Network management and multimedia data mining techniques have a great interest in analyzing and improving the network traffic process. In recent times, the most complex task in Software Defined Network (SDN) is security, which is based on a centralized, programmable controller. Therefore, monitoring network traffic is significant for identifying and revealing intrusion abnormalities in the SDN environment. Consequently, this paper provides an extensive analysis and investigation of the NSL-KDD dataset using five different clustering algorithms: K-means, Farthest First, Canopy, Density-based algorithm, and Exception-maximization (EM), using the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) software to compare extensively between these five algorithms. Furthermore, this paper presents an SDN-based intrusion detection system using a deep learning (DL) model with the KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) dataset. First, the utilized dataset is clustered into normal and four major attack categories via the clustering process. Then, a deep learning method is projected for building an efficient SDN-based intrusion detection system. The results provide a comprehensive analysis and a flawless reasonable study of different kinds of attacks incorporated in the KDD dataset. Similarly, the outcomes reveal that the proposed deep learning method provides efficient intrusion detection performance compared to existing techniques. For example, the proposed method achieves a detection accuracy of 94.21% for the examined dataset. © 2022 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Internet of vehicles (IoVs) allows millions of vehicles to be connected and share information for various purposes. The main applications of IoVs are traffic management, emergency messages delivery, E-health, traffic, and temperature monitoring. On the other hand, IoVs lack in location awareness and geographic distribution, which is critical for some IoVs applications such as smart traffic lights and information sharing in vehicles. To support these topographies, fog computing was proposed as an appealing and novel term, which was integrated with IoVs to extend storage, computation, and networking. Unfortunately, it is also challenged with various security and privacy hazards, which is a serious concern of smart cities. Therefore, we can formulate that Fog-assisted IoVs (Fa-IoVs), are challenged by security threats during information dissemination among mobile nodes. These security threats of Fa-IoVs are considered as anomalies which is a serious concern that needs to be addressed for smooth Fa-IoVs network communication. Here, smooth communication refers to less risk of important data loss, delay, communication overhead, etc. This research work aims to identify research gaps in the Fa-IoVs network and present a deep learning-based dynamic scheme named CAaDet (Convolutional autoencoder Aided anomaly detection) to detect anomalies. CAaDet exploits convolutional layers with a customized autoencoder for useful feature extraction and anomaly detection. Performance evaluation of the proposed scheme is done by using the F1-score metric where experiments are carried out by exploiting a benchmark dataset named NSL-KDD. CAaDet also observes the behavior of fog nodes and hidden neurons and selects the best match to reduce false alarms and improve F1-score. The proposed scheme achieved significant improvement over existing schemes for anomaly detection. Identified research gaps in Fa-IoVs can give future directions to researchers and attract more attention to this new era. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Anomaly-based intrusion detection methods aim to combat the increasing rate of zero-day attacks, however, their success is currently restricted to the detection of high-volume attacks using aggregated traffic features. Recent evaluations show that the current anomaly-based network intrusion detection methods fail to reliably detect remote access attacks. These are smaller in volume and often only stand out when compared to their surroundings. Currently, anomaly methods try to detect access attack events mainly as point anomalies and neglect the context they appear in. We present and examine a contextual bidirectional anomaly model (CBAM) based on deep LSTM-networks that is specifically designed to detect such attacks as contextual network anomalies. The model efficiently learns short-term sequential patterns in network flows as conditional event probabilities. Access attacks frequently break these patterns when exploiting vulnerabilities, and can thus be detected as contextual anomalies. We evaluated CBAM on an assembly of three datasets that provide both representative network access attacks, real-life traffic over a long timespan, and traffic from a real-world red-team attack. We contend that this assembly is closer to a potential deployment environment than current NIDS benchmark datasets. We show that, by building a deep model, we are able to reduce the false positive rate to 0.16% while effectively detecting six out of seven access attacks, which is significantly lower than the operational range of other methods. We further demonstrate that short-term flow structures remain stable over long periods of time, making the CBAM robust against concept drift. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Detecting anomalies, intrusions, and security threats in the network (including Internet of Things) traffic necessitates the processing of large volumes of sensitive data, which raises concerns about privacy and security. Federated learning, a distributed machine learning approach, enables multiple parties to collaboratively train a shared model while preserving data decentralization and privacy. In a federated learning environment, instead of training and evaluating the model on a single machine, each client learns a local model with the same structure but is trained on different local datasets. These local models are then communicated to an aggregation server that employs federated averaging to aggregate them and produce an optimized global model. This approach offers significant benefits for developing efficient and effective intrusion detection system (IDS) solutions. In this research, we investigated the effectiveness of federated learning for IDSs and compared it with that of traditional deep learning models. Our findings demonstrate that federated learning, by utilizing random client selection, achieved higher accuracy and lower loss compared to deep learning, particularly in scenarios emphasizing data privacy and security. Our experiments highlight the capability of federated learning to create global models without sharing sensitive data, thereby mitigating the risks associated with data breaches or leakage. The results suggest that federated averaging in federated learning has the potential to revolutionize the development of IDS solutions, thus making them more secure, efficient, and effective. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={Traditional firewalls and data encryption techniques can no longer match the demands of current IoT network security due to the rising amount and variety of network threats. In order to manage IoT network risks, intrusion detection solutions have been advised. Even though machine learning (ML) helps the widely used intrusion detection techniques currently in use, these algorithms struggle with low detection rates and the requirement for extensive feature engineering. The deep learning model for IoT network intrusion detection is a method for traffic anomaly detection that is suggested by this study. To extract the sequence properties of data flow through a CNN, it combines an attention mechanism with a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network. This method uses adaptive synthetic sampling (ADASYN) to increase the size of minority-class samples. The proposed models demonstrated acceptable precision and recall for each class when used for binary-class classification, proving their stability and capacity to identify all classes correctly. The MLP classifier’s accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 value were 87%, 89%, 87%, and 89%, respectively, with an AUC score of 0.88. Overall, the proposed models performed well. The attack and all-class models exhibited good AUCs and macro metrics, the same as the proposed MLP classifier, which had an F1 score of 83% and an AUC score of 0.94. Additionally, it trained the MLP classifier and integrated the ADAM optimizer and category cross-entropy loss function for all-class classification. With an AUC value of 94%, it possessed 84% accuracy, 87% precision, 84% recall, and an 83% F1 score. A further indication of the hybrid model’s ability to combine the benefits of both models to improve overall performance was that it regularly outperformed the MLP model. This model’s accuracy and F1 score are better than those of earlier comparable algorithms, according to experimental results using the publicly accessible benchmark dataset for network intrusion detection (NSL–KDD). © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={Modern networks are at risk from a variety of threats as a result of the enormous growth in internet-based traffic. By consuming time and resources, intrusive traffic hampers the efficient operation of network infrastructure. An effective strategy for preventing, detecting, and mitigating intrusion incidents will increase productivity. A crucial element of secure network traffic is Intrusion Detection System (IDS). An IDS system may be host-based or network-based to monitor intrusive network activity. Finding unusual internet traffic has become a severe security risk for intelligent devices. These systems are negatively impacted by several attacks, which are slowing computation. In addition, networked communication anomalies and breaches must be detected using Machine Learning (ML). This paper uses the NSL-KDD data set to propose a novel IDS based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). As a result, theML model generalizes sufficiently to perform well on untried data. The NSL-KDD dataset shall be utilized for both training and testing. In this paper, we present a custom ANN model architecture using the Keras open-source software package. The specific arrangement of nodes and layers, along with the activation functions, enhances the model's ability to capture intricate patterns in network data. The performance of the ANN is carefully tested and evaluated, resulting in the identification of a maximum detection accuracy of 97.5%. We thoroughly compared our suggested model to industry-recognized benchmarkmethods, such as decision classifier combinations and ML classifiers like k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Deep Learning (DL), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Deep Neural Network (DNN), and ANN. It is encouraging to see that our model consistently outperformed each of these tried-and-true techniques in all evaluations. This result underlines the effectiveness of the suggestedmethodology by demonstrating the ANN's capacity to accurately assess the effectiveness of the developed strategy in identifying and categorizing instances of network intrusion. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

abstract={Network intrusion detection, which takes the extraction and analysis of network traffic features as the main method, plays a vital role in network security protection. The current network traffic feature extraction and analysis for network intrusion detection mostly uses deep learning algorithms. Currently, deep learning requires a lot of training resources and has weak processing capabilities for imbalanced datasets. In this paper, a deep learning model (MFVT) based on feature fusion network and vision transformer architecture is proposed, which improves the processing ability of imbalanced datasets and reduces the sample data resources needed for training. Besides, to improve the traditional raw traffic features extraction methods, a new raw traffic features extraction method (CRP) is proposed, and the CPR uses PCA algorithm to reduce all the processed digital traffic features to the specified dimension. On the IDS 2017 dataset and the IDS 2012 dataset, the ablation experiments show that the performance of the proposed MFVT model is significantly better than other network intrusion detection models, and the detection accuracy can reach the state-of-the-art level. And, when MFVT model is combined with CRP algorithm, the detection accuracy is further improved to 99.99%. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={A Software-Defined Network (SDN) was designed to simplify network management by allowing the control and management of the entire network from a single place. SDN is commonly used in today's data center network infrastructure, but new forms of threats such as Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS), web attacks, and the U2R (User to Root) attack are significant issues that might restrict the widespread adoption of SDNs. Intruders are attractive to SDN controllers because they are valuable targets. An SDN controller can be hijacked by an attacker and used to route traffic in accordance with its own needs, resulting in catastrophic consequences for the whole network. While the unified vision of SDN and deep learning methods opens new possibilities for the security of IDS deployment, the effectiveness of the detection models is dependent on the quality of the training datasets. Even though deep learning for NIDSs has lately shown promising results for a number of issues, the majority of the studies overlooked the impact of data redundancy and an unbalanced dataset. As a consequence, this may adversely affect the resilience of the anomaly detection system, resulting in a suboptimal model performance. In this study, we created a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network to enhance network intrusion detection using binary and multiclass classification. The effectiveness of the proposed model was tested and assessed using the most frequently used datasets (UNSW-NB15 and NSL-KDD). In addition, we used the InSDN dataset, which is specifically dedicated to SDN. The outcomes demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model in achieving high accuracy and requiring less training time. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Deep learning (DL) methods have been widely applied to anomaly-based network intrusion detection system (NIDS) to detect malicious traffic. To expand the usage scenarios of DL-based methods, federated learning (FL) allows multiple users to train a global model on the basis of respecting individual data privacy. However, it has not yet been systematically evaluated how robust FL-based NIDSs are against existing privacy attacks under existing defenses. To address this issue, we propose two privacy evaluation metrics designed for FL-based NIDSs, including (1) privacy score that evaluates the similarity between the original and recovered traffic features using reconstruction attacks, and (2) evasion rate against NIDSs using adversarial attack with the recovered traffic. We conduct experiments to illustrate that existing defenses provide little protection and the corresponding adversarial traffic can even evade the SOTA NIDS Kitsune. To defend against such attacks and build a more robust FL-based NIDS, we further propose FedDef, a novel optimization-based input perturbation defense strategy with theoretical guarantee. It achieves both high utility by minimizing the gradient distance and strong privacy protection by maximizing the input distance. We experimentally evaluate four existing defenses on four datasets and show that our defense outperforms all the baselines in terms of privacy protection with up to 7 times higher privacy score, while maintaining model accuracy loss within 3% under optimal parameter combination. © 2023 IEEE.},

abstract={Anomaly detection and multi-attack classification are major concerns for cyber defense. Several publicly available datasets have been used extensively for the evaluation of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). However, most of the publicly available datasets may not contain attack scenarios based on evolving threats. The development of a robust network intrusion dataset is vital for network threat analysis and mitigation. Proactive IDSs are required to tackle ever-growing threats in cyberspace. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models have been deployed recently to detect the various types of cyber-attacks. However, current IDSs struggle to attain both a high detection rate and a low false alarm rate. To address these issues, we first develop a Center for Cyber Defense (CCD)-IDSv1 labeled flow-based dataset in an OpenStack environment. Five different attacks with normal usage imitating real-life usage are implemented. The number of network features is increased to overcome the shortcomings of the previous network flow-based datasets such as CIDDS and CIC-IDS2017. Secondly, this paper presents a comparative analysis on the effectiveness of different ML and DL models on our CCD-IDSv1 dataset. In this study, we consider both cyber anomaly detection and multi-attack classification. To improve the performance, we developed two DL-based ensemble models: Ensemble-CNN-10 and Ensemble-CNN-LSTM. Ensemble-CNN-10 combines 10 CNN models developed from 10-fold cross-validation, whereas Ensemble-CNN-LSTM combines base CNN and LSTM models. This paper also presents feature importance for both anomaly detection and multi-attack classification. Overall, the proposed ensemble models performed well in both the 10-fold cross-validation and independent testing on our dataset. Together, these results suggest the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed IDSs based on ML and DL models on the CCD-IDSv1 intrusion detection dataset. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={Nowadays, network intrusion detection is an essential problem because cyber-attacks are increasing in both the number and extent of the danger. Network intrusion techniques often use various methods to bypass the oversight of anomaly detection and surveillance systems. This paper proposes to use behavior analysis techniques, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms for the task of detecting network intrusions. The practical and scientific significance of our paper includes two issues: (1) Regarding the process of selecting and extracting features: instead of using typical abnormal behaviors of attacks, this study will use statistical behaviors that are easy to calculate and extract while still ensuring the effectiveness of the method; Regarding the detection process, this study proposes to use the Random Forest (RF) classification algorithm, the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) deep learning model. The experimental results in Section IV have proven that our proposal in this paper is completely correct and reasonable. Based on the results shown in Section IV, this study has provided network surveillance systems with a number of abnormal behaviors as the basis for detecting network intrusions. © 2021},

abstract={Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs) enable vehicle-infrastructure communication, enhancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Vehicles interconnect wirelessly to share information. Still, this communication is vulnerable to various attacks, particularly in Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) scenarios. This study proposes an Artificial Intelligence-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) in an edge-envisioned environment, combining edge computing and deep learning. The approach uses the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for edge node selection to perform packet forwarding and employs a Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Network (BiGAN) for intrusion detection. This poses a challenge since regular traffic samples are typically more prevalent than anomalous traffic, and the dataset is unstructured and highly imbalanced. Our BiGAN-based model overcomes synchronization challenges between generator and discriminator networks. Training iterations increase independently until cross-entropy loss conditions are met. The trained encoder-discriminator network is a single-class classifier, distinguishing normal and abnormal data. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance on the NSL-KDD dataset compared to similar methods. © 2024 THE AUTHORS},

abstract={The intrusion detection system (IDS) is a promising technology for ensuring security against cyber-attacks in internet-of-things networks. In conventional IDS, anomaly detection and feature extraction are performed by two different models. In this paper, we propose a new integrated model based on deep autoencoder (AE) for anomaly detection and feature extraction. Firstly, AE is trained based on normal network traffic and used later to detect anomalies. Then, the trained AE model is employed again to extract useful low-dimensional features for anomalous data without the need for a feature extraction training stage, which is required by other methods such as principal components analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). After that, the extracted features are used by a machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL) classifier to determine the type of attack (multi-classification). The performance of the proposed unified approach was evaluated on real IoT datasets called N-BaIoT and MQTTset, which contain normal and malicious network traffics. The proposed AE was compared with other popular anomaly detection techniques such as one-class support vector machine (OC-SVM) and isolation forest (iForest), in terms of performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score), and execution time. AE was found to identify attacks better than OC-SVM and iForest with fast detection time. The proposed feature extraction method aims to reduce the computation complexity while maintaining the performance metrics of the multi-classifier models as much as possible compared to their counterparts. We tested the model with different ML/DL classifiers such as decision tree, random forest, deep neural network (DNN), conventional neural network (CNN), and hybrid CNN with long short-term memory (LSTM). The experiment results showed the capability of the proposed model to simultaneously detect anomalous events and reduce the dimensionality of the data. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={Smart grids (SGs), a cornerstone of modern power systems, facilitate efficient management and distribution of electricity. Despite their advantages, increased connectivity and reliance on communication networks expand their susceptibility to cyber threats. Machine learning (ML) can radically transform cyber security in SGs and secure protocols as in IEC 60870 standard, an international standard for electric power system communication. Notwithstanding, cyber adversaries are now exploiting ML-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) using adversarial ML attacks, potentially undermining SG security. This article addresses cyber attacks on the communication network of SGs, specifically targeting the IEC 60870-5-104 protocol. We introduce a novel ML-based IDS framework for the IEC 60870-5-104 protocol. Specifically, we employ an artificial neural network (ANN) to analyze a new and realistically representative dataset of IEC 60870-5-104 traffic data, unlike previous research that relies on simulated or unrelated data. This approach assists in identifying anomalies indicative of cyber attacks more accurately. Furthermore, we evaluate the resilience of our ANN model against adversarial attacks, including the fast gradient sign method, projected gradient descent, and Carlini and Wagner attacks. Our results demonstrate that the proposed framework can accurately detect cyber attacks and remains robust to adversarial attacks. This offers efficient and resilient IDS capabilities to detect and mitigate cyber attacks in real-world ML-based adversarial environments. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Software-defined networking (SDN) represents a paradigm shift in network traffic management. It distinguishes between the data and control planes. APIs are then used to communicate between these planes. The controller is central to the management of an SDN network and is subject to security concerns. This research shows how a deep learning algorithm can detect intrusions in SDN-based IoT networks. Overfitting, low accuracy, and efficient feature selection is all discussed. We propose a hybrid machine learning-based approach based on Random Forest and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). In this study, a new dataset based specifically on Software Defined Networks is used in SDN. To obtain the best and most relevant features, a feature selection technique is used. Several experiments have revealed that the proposed solution is a superior method for detecting flow-based anomalies. The performance of our proposed model is also measured in terms of accuracy, recall, and precision. F1 rating and detection time Furthermore, a lightweight model for training is proposed, which selects fewer features while maintaining the model’s performance. Experiments show that the adopted methodology outperforms existing models. © 2023 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The intrusion detection system (IDS) must be able to handle the increase in attack volume, increasing Internet traffic, and accelerating detection speeds. Network flow feature (NTF) records are the input of flow-based IDSs that are used to determine whether network traffic is normal or malicious in order to avoid IDS from difficult and time-consuming packet content inspection processing since only flow records are examined. To reduce computational power and training time, this paper proposes a novel pre-processing method merging a specific amount of NTF records into frames, and frame transformation into images. Federated learning (FL) enables multiple users to share the learned models while maintaining the privacy of their training data. This research suggests federated transfer learning and federated learning methods for NIDS employing deep learning for image classification and conducting tests on the BOUN DDoS dataset to address the issue of training data privacy. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed Federated transfer learning (FTL) and FL methods for training do not require data centralization and preserve participant data privacy while achieving acceptable accuracy in DDoS attack identification: FTL (92.99%) and FL (88.42%) in comparison with Traditional transfer learning (93.95%). © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={At present data transmission widely uses wireless network framework for transmitting large volume of data. It generates numerous security problems and privacy issues which laid a way for developing IDS. IDS act as preventive technique in securing computer networks. Previously there are numerous metaheuristic and deep learning algorithms used in IDS for detecting threats. Some are affected by dynamic growth of feature spaces and others are degraded in performance during detection of threats. One fine-grained model for intrusion detection can be developed by selecting accurate features and testing them with the intelligent algorithms. Based on these explorations, in this research IDS is implemented with intelligence from preprocessing to feature classification. At first stage, data preprocessing is done using binning concept to reduce noise. Secondly feature selection is done dynamically using dynamic tree growth algorithm with fire fly optimization techniques. Finally, these features are processed using DTB-FFNN for detecting anomalies perfectly. This DTB-FFNN is evaluated with popular KDD dataset. Our proposed model cable news network (CNN)-classification is compared with existing intelligent techniques: feed forward deep neural network, support vectors machines, decision tree, and CNN-clustering is compared with k-means, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN). The experimental outcome proves that dynamic tree based FFNN and CNN-clustering produce higher accuracy than the existing models. © 2022, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

abstract={The prevalence of cyber-attacks perpetrated over the last two decades, including coordinated attempts to breach targeted organizations, has drastically and systematically exposed some of the more critical vulnerabilities existing in our cyber ecosystem. Particularly in Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems with targeted attacks aiming to bypass signature-based protocols, attempting to gain control over operational processes. In the past, researchers utilized deep learning and reinforcement learning algorithms to mitigate threats against industrial control systems (ICS). However, as technology evolves, these techniques become ineffective in monitoring and enhancing the cybersecurity defenses of those system against unwanted attacks. To address these concerns, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for anomaly detection in the SCADA network. Our model utilizes a 'Q-network', which allows it to achieve state-of-the-art performance in pattern recognition from complex tasks. We validated our solution on two publicly available datasets. The WUSTL-IIoT-2018 and the WUSTL-IIoT-2021, each comprised of twenty-five networking features representing benign and attack traffic. The results obtained shows that our model successfully achieved an accuracy of 99.36% in attack detection, highlighting DRL's potential to enhance the security of critical infrastructure and laying the foundation for future research in this domain. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Due to the severe imbalance in the quantities of normal samples and attack samples, as well as among different types of attack samples, intrusion detection systems suffer from low detection rates for rare-class attack data. In this paper, we propose a geometric synthetic minority oversampling technique based on the optimized kernel density estimation algorithm. This method can generate diverse rare-class attack data by learning the distribution of rare-class attack data while maintaining similarity with the original sample features. Meanwhile, the balanced data is input to a feature extraction module built upon multiple denoising autoencoders, reducing information redundancy in high-dimensional data and improving the detection performance for unknown attacks. Subsequently, a soft-voting ensemble learning technique is utilized for multi-class anomaly detection on the balanced and dimensionally reduced data. Finally, an intrusion detection system is constructed based on data preprocessing, imbalance handling, feature extraction, and anomaly detection modules. The performance of the system was evaluated using two datasets, NSL-KDD and N-BaIoT, achieving 86.39% and 99.94% multiclassification accuracy, respectively. Through ablation experiments and comparison with the baseline model, it is found that the inherent limitations of a single machine-learning model directly affect the accuracy of the intrusion detection system, while the superiority of the proposed multi-module model in detecting unknown attacks and rare classes of attack traffic is demonstrated. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={The network infrastructure has evolved rapidly due to the ever-increasing volume of users and data. The massive number of online devices and users has forced the network to transform and facilitate the operational necessities of consumers. Among these necessities, network security is of prime significance. Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) are among the most suitable approaches to detect anomalies and assaults on a network. However, keeping up with the network security requirements is quite challenging due to the constant mutation in attack patterns by the intruders. This paper presents an effective and prevalent framework for NIDS by merging image processing with convolution neural networks (CNN). The proposed framework first converts non-image data from network traffic into images and then further enhances those images by using the Gabor filter. The images are then classified using a CNN classifier. To assess the efficacy of the recommended method, four benchmark datasets i.e., CSE-CIC-IDS2018, CIC-IDS-2017, ISCX-IDS 2012, and NSL-KDD were used. The proposed approach showed higher precision in contrast with the recent work on the mentioned datasets. Further, the proposed method is compared with the recent well-known image processing methods for NIDS. © 2022 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) networks leverage wireless communication protocols, which adversaries can exploit. Impersonation attacks, injection attacks, and flooding are several examples of different attacks existing in Wi-Fi networks. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) became one solution to distinguish those attacks from benign traffic. Deep learning techniques have been intensively utilized to classify the attacks. However, the main issue of utilizing deep learning models is projecting the data, notably tabular data, into an image. This study proposes a novel projection from wireless network attacks data into a grid-based image for feeding one of theConvolutionalNeural Network (CNN) models, EfficientNet. We define the particular sequence of placing the attribute values in a grid that would be captured as an image. Combining the most important subset of attributes and EfficientNet, we aim for an accurate and lightweight IDS module deployed in IoT networks. We examine the proposed model using the Wi-Fi attacks dataset, called the AWID2 dataset. We achieve the best performance by a 99.91% F1 score and 0.11% false-positive rate. In addition, our proposed model achieved comparable results with other statistical machine learning models, which shows that our proposed model successfully exploited the spatial information of tabular data to maintain detection accuracy. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

abstract={Cyber-attacks on cyber-physical systems (CPSs) resulted to sensing and actuation misbehavior, severe damage to physical object, and safety risk. Machine learning (ML) models have been presented to hinder cyberattacks on the CPS environment; however, the non-existence of labelled data from new attacks makes their detection quite interesting. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a commonly utilized to detect and classify the existence of intrusions in the CPS environment, which acts as an important part in secure CPS environment. Latest developments in deep learning (DL) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) stimulate new IDSs to manage cyberattacks with minimum complexity and high sophistication. In this aspect, this paper presents an XAI based IDS using feature selection with Dirichlet Variational Autoencoder (XAIIDS-FSDVAE) model for CPS. The proposed model encompasses the design of coyote optimization algorithm (COA) based feature selection (FS) model is derived to select an optimal subset of features. Next, an intelligent Dirichlet Variational Autoencoder (DVAE) technique is employed for the anomaly detection process in the CPS environment. Finally, the parameter optimization of the DVAE takes place using a manta ray foraging optimization (MRFO) model to tune the parameter of the DVAE. In order to determine the enhanced intrusion detection efficiency of the XAIIDS-FSDVAE technique, a wide range of simulations take place using the benchmark datasets. The experimental results reported the better performance of the XAIIDS-FSDVAE technique over the recent methods in terms of several evaluation parameters. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

abstract={The exponential rise in the number of malicious threats targeting computer networks and digital services puts network infrastructure in jeopardy. Domain name protocol attacks are one of the most pervasive network attacks posing a threat to networks, whereby attackers send harmful information to the network; this type of threat is identified as DNS tunneling. The DNS protocol has recently gained increased attention from cyber-attackers, targeting organizations with a web presence or reliance on e-commerce businesses. Cyber-attackers can subtly exploit the contents of encrypted DNS packets that are sent across covert network tunnels, which are difficult for firewalls and blacklist detection methods to detect. Therefore, efficient methods for detecting DNS intrusions in the network are required. Machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and computational intelligence models have proved to be increasingly effective in dealing with these cyber-attacks, especially when using an appropriate dataset. This paper proposes an intrusion detection model to detect malicious DNS over HTTPS (DoH) queries among network covert tunnels, using statistical analysis and Bi-directional Recurrent Neural Network (BRNN) techniques, based on the flow level of the network traffic. The proposed approach was tested and evaluated based on a realistic dataset called CIRA-CIC-DoHBrw-2020, provided by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity. Experiments have shown that the robustness of the model is strong, with a detection rate of 100%. Furthermore, the proposed model achieved high performance in terms of the accuracy rate in detecting malicious DoH queries, with low false-negative and false-positive rates. Furthermore, the number of features used is fewer than other approaches, making it perform faster in the training and testing phases. © 2021 University of Kerbala. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are deployed to detect anomalies in real time. They classify a network's incoming traffic as benign or anomalous (attack). An efficient and robust IDS in software-defined networks is an inevitable component of network security. The main challenges of such an IDS are achieving zero or extremely low false positive rates and high detection rates. Internet of Things (IoT) networks run by using devices with minimal resources. This situation makes deploying traditional IDSs in IoT networks unfeasible. Machine learning (ML) techniques are extensively applied to build robust IDSs. Many researchers have utilized different ML methods and techniques to address the above challenges. The development of an efficient IDS starts with a good feature selection process to avoid overfitting the ML model. This work proposes a multiple feature selection process followed by classification. In this study, the Software-defined networking (SDN) dataset is used to train and test the proposed model. This model applies multiple feature selection techniques to select high-scoring features from a set of features. Highly relevant features for anomaly detection are selected on the basis of their scores to generate the candidate dataset. Multiple classification algorithms are applied to the candidate dataset to build models. The proposed model exhibits considerable improvement in the detection of attacks with high accuracy and low false positive rates, even with a few features selected. © 1996-2012 Tsinghua University Press.},

abstract={In recent years, low recall rates and high dependencies on data labelling have become the biggest obstacle to developing deep anomaly detection (DAD) techniques. Inspired by the success of generative adversarial networks (GANs) in detecting anomalies in computer vision and imaging, we propose an anomaly detection model called FlowGANAnomaly for detecting anomalous traffic in network intrusion detection systems (NIDS). Unlike traditional GAN-based approaches, which are composed of a flow encoder, a convolutional encoder-decoder-encoder, a flow decoder and a convolutional encoder, the architecture of this model consists of a generator (G) and a discriminator (D). FlowGANAnomaly maps the different types of traffic feature data from separate datasets to a uniform feature space, thus can capture the normality of network traffic data more accurately in an adversarial manner to mitigate the problem of the high dependence on data labeling. Moreover, instead of simply detecting the anomalies by the output of D, we proposed a new anomaly scoring method that integrates the deviation between the output of two Gs' convolutional encoders with the output of D as weighted scores to improve the low recall rate of anomaly detection. We conducted several experiments comparing existing machine learning algorithms and existing deep learning methods (AutoEncoder and VAE) on four public datasets (NSL-KDD, CIC-IDS2017, CIC-DDoS2019, and UNSW-NB15). The evaluation results show that FlowGANAnomaly can significantly improve the performance of anomaly-based NIDS. © 2015 Chinese Institute of Electronics.},

abstract={Agriculture has played a significant role in the lifespan of human beings for their survival and the better economic growth of the country. Due to its intensified growth, smart agriculture has been a popular domain recently. This aggregates the benefits of any computing technologies, like wireless sensor networks (WSN), drones, Internet of Things (IoT), remote sensing, etc. The IoT system places sensors on agricultural areas to accumulate critical information for the crops and fields to increase the overall rate of productivity. While broadcasting the sensed information in the domains to the target, there is a chance of the existence of cyber-threats, which intruders design to attain access to the content being transferred. Intrusion detection in IoT-based smart farming using deep learning (DL) leverages the power of deep neural networks (DNN) to safeguard agricultural systems from cyber threats. DL algorithms can autonomously detect unauthorized and anomalies activities by analyzing data streams from sensors, IoT devices, and farm management systems. With this motivation, this study designs an Enhanced Black Widow Optimization with Hybrid Deep Learning Enabled Intrusion Detection (EBWO-HDLID) technique in the IoT-based Smart Farming environment. The proposed EBWO-HDLID technique captures complex patterns and detects significant intrusions, assuring the security and reliability of smart farming. In the presented EBWO-HDLID approach, the bald eagle search (BES) algorithm can be used for the feature selection process. For the intrusion detection and classification process, the EBWO-HDLID technique applies the HDL classification model. Finally, the EBWO algorithm can be used for the parameter tuning of the HDL technique. The experimental validation process demonstrates the satisfactory performance of the EBWO-HDLID model on two benchmark datasets: ToN-IoT, and Edge-IIoTset datasets. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Recently, cyberattacks have been more complex than in the past, as a new cyber-attack is initiated almost every day. Therefore, researchers should develop efficient intrusion detection systems (IDS) to detect cyber-attacks. In order to improve the detection and prevention of the aforementioned cyber-attacks, several articles developed IDSs exploiting machine learning and deep learning. In this paper, a way to find network intrusions using a combination of feature selection and adoptive voting is investigated. NSL-KDD dataset, a high-dimensional dataset that has been widely used for network intrusion detection, is applied in this approach. Feature selection plays an important role for improving accuracy and testing time as it eliminates the less significant attributes from the data set, thus saving computational power and effort. The experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves an accuracy of 86.5% on the NSL-KDD test dataset using an adoptive voting algorithm trained with the selected features. In addition, the time to process each record is 97.5 microseconds, which reflects the proposed model's superior performance. Comparing the proposed model with the existing models in the literature shows that the proposed adaptive voting approach significantly improves intrusion detection accuracy, enhances computational efficiency, and reduces false positives. © 2023 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) based Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) contain interconnected autonomous sensor nodes (SN), which wirelessly communicate with each other and the wider internet structure. Intrusion detection to secure IoT-based WSNs is critical for identifying and responding to great security attacks and threats that can cooperate with the integrity, availability, and privacy of the network and its data. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are deployed for detecting difficult patterns and subtle anomalies in IoT data. Artificial intelligence (AI) driven methods are learned and adapted from novel data for improving detection accuracy over time. In this article, we introduce a Red Kite Optimization Algorithm with an Average Ensemble Model for Intrusion Detection (RKOA-AEID) technique for Secure IoT-based WSN. The purpose of the RKOA-AEID methodology is to accomplish security solutions for IoT-assisted WSNs. To accomplish this, the RKOA-AEID technique performs pre-processing to scale the input data using min-max normalization. In addition, the RKOA-AEID technique performs an RKOA-based feature selection approach to elect an optimum set of features. For intrusion detection, an average ensemble learning model is used. Finally, the Lévy-fight chaotic whale optimization Algorithm (LCWOA) can be executed for the optimum hyperparameter chosen for the ensemble models. The performance evaluation of the RKOA-AEID algorithm can be tested on the benchmark WSN-DS dataset. The extensive experimental outcomes stated the higher outcome of the RKOA-AEID algorithm with other approaches with an improved accuracy of 98.94%. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Powered by advances in information and internet technologies, network-based applications have developed rapidly, and cybersecurity has grown more critical. Inspired by Reinforcement Learning (RL) success in many domains, this paper proposes an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to improve cybersecurity. The IDS based on two RL algorithms, i.e., Deep Q-Learning and Policy Gradient, is carefully formulated, strategically designed, and thoroughly evaluated at the packet-level and flow-level using the CICDDoS2019 dataset. Compared to other research work in a similar line of research, this paper is focused on providing a systematic and complete design paradigm of IDS based on RL algorithms, at both the packet and flow levels. For the packet-level RL-based IDS, first, the session data are transformed into images via an image embedding method proposed in this work. A comparison between 1D-Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNN) and CNN for extracting features from these images (for further RL agent training) is drawn from the quantitative results. In addition, an anomaly detection module is designed to detect unknown network traffic. For flow-level IDS, a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) and the (Formula presented.) -greedy strategy are adopted in designing the exploration module for RL agent training. To improve the robustness of the intrusion detection, a sample agent with a complement reward policy of the RL agent is introduced for the purpose of adversarial training. The experimental results of the proposed RL-based IDS show improved results over the state-of-the-art algorithms presented in the literature for packet-level and flow-level IDS. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={Uncommon observations that significantly vary from the norm are referred to as outliers. Outlier detection, which aims to detect unexpected behavior, is a critical topic that has attracted significant attention in a wide range of research areas and application domains, including video surveillance, network intrusion detection, disease outbreak detection, and others. Deep learning-based techniques for outlier detection have currently outperformed machine learning and shallow approaches on streaming data, which are big and complicated datasets. Despite the fact that deep learning has been successfully applied in a variety of application domains, developing an effective and appropriate model is a difficult task due to the dynamic nature and variations of real-world applications and data. Hence, this research proposes a novel deep learning model based on a deep neural network (DNN) to handle the outlier detection problem in the context of streaming data. The proposed DNN model is developed with multiple hidden layers to improve feature abstraction and capabilities. Extensive experiments performed on four real-world outlier benchmark datasets, available at the UCI repository, and comparisons to state-of-the-art approaches are used to evaluate the proposed model's performance. Experiment results demonstrate that it outperforms both machine learning algorithms and deep learning competitors, resulting in significant performance gains. Particularly, when compared to other algorithms, the evaluation results clearly demonstrated the efficacy of the proposed approach, with much higher accuracy, recall and f1-score rates of 99.63%, 99.014% and 99.437%, respectively. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={Fog computing, as a new distributed computing framework, extends the tasks originally done in the cloud data center to the edge of the network and brings more serious security challenges while providing convenience. Abnormal network traffic detection is an effective means to defense malicious behavior, can detect a variety of known attacks. Although the application of deep learning method in the field of network abnormal traffic detection is easier than traditional machine learning methods, there are still problems of poor recognition accuracy and false alarm rate. In this paper, we use the semi-supervised network anomaly detection model (NADLA) that combines the long-short-term memory neural network method and the self-encoder method to solve this problem. NADLA analyzes network traffic through the time characteristics and behavior characteristics of traffic, and optimizes the accuracy and false alarm rate of network traffic classification. In addition, we improved the preprocessing method to improve the sensitivity of the trained model to network abnormal traffic. The NADLA model is tested on NSL-KDD dataset, and the results show that the proposed model can improve the accuracy and F1-value of network anomaly traffic detection. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={The network intrusion detection system (NIDs) is a significant research milestone in information security. NIDs can scan and analyze the network to detect an attack or anomaly, which may be a continuing intrusion or perhaps an intrusion that has just occurred. During the pandemic, cybercriminals realized that home networks lurked with vulnerabilities due to a lack of security and computational limitations. A fundamental difficulty in NIDs is providing an effective, robust, lightweight, and rapid framework to perform real-time intrusion detection. This research proposes an efficient, functional cybersecurity approach based on machine/deep learning algorithms to detect anomalies using lightweight network-based IDs. A lightweight, real-time, network-based anomaly detection system can be used to secure connected IoT devices. The UNSW-NB15 dataset is used to evaluate the proposed approach DeepNet and compare results alongside other state-of-the-art existing techniques. For the classification of network-based anomalies, the proposed model achieves 99.16% accuracy by using all features and 99.14% accuracy after feature reduction. The experimental results show that the network anomalies depend exceptionally on features selected after selection. © 2022 Syed Ibrahim Imtiaz et al.},

abstract={In this modern era, due to demand for cloud environments in business, the size, complexity, and chance of attacks to virtual cloud network (VCN) are increased. The protection of VCN is required to maintain the faith of the cloud users. Intrusion detection is essential to secure any network. The existing approaches that use the conventional neural network cannot utilize all information for identifying the intrusions. In this paper, the anomaly-based NIDS for VCN is proposed. For feature selection, grey wolf optimization (GWO) is hybridized with a bald eagle search (BES) algorithm. For classification, a deep learning approach-deep sparse auto-encoder (DSAE)-is employed. In this way, this paper proposes a NIDS model for VCN named GWO-DES-DSAE. The proposed system is simulated in the python programming environment. The proposed NIDS model's performance is compared with other recent approaches for both binary and multi-class classification on the considered datasets-NSLKDD, UNSW-NB15, and CICIDS 2017-and found better than other methods. © 2021 IGI Global.},

abstract={The expansion of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) market is visible in homes, factories, public places, and smart cities. While the massive deployment of connected devices offers opportunities to improve quality of life and to develop new services, the impact of such devices on the security of the users in a context where the level of malicious threat continues to increase is a major concern. One of the challenges is the heterogeneity and constant evolution of wireless technologies and protocols used. To overcome this problem, we propose RIDS, a Radio Intrusion Detection System that is based on the monitoring and profiling of radio communications at the physical layer level using autoencoder neural networks. RIDS is independent of the wireless protocols and modulation technologies used. Besides, it is designed to provide a threefold diagnosis of the detected anomalies: temporal (start and end date of the detected anomaly), frequential (main frequency of the anomaly), and spatial (location of the origin of the anomaly). To demonstrate the relevance and the efficiency of our approach, we collected a large dataset of radio-communications recorded with three different probes deployed in an experimental room. Multiple real-world attacks involving a wide variety of communication technologies are also injected to assess the detection and diagnosis efficiency. The results demonstrate the efficiency of RIDS in detecting and diagnosing anomalies that occurred in the 400-500 Mhz and 800-900 Mhz frequency bands. It is noteworthy that compromised devices and attacks using these communication bands are generally not easily covered by traditional solutions. © 2021 ACM.},

abstract={A masquerader is an attacker who gains illegitimate access to a user's account. Masquerade detection is one of the key problems of intrusion detection systems. Deep learning models that obtained state-of-the-art results in masquerade detection have failed to exhibit very high detection performance when data samples contain limited information. Alternatively, computationally cheaper and more memory-efficient traditional machine learning models suffer from less robust features, which hinders them in achieving high detection performance. The contributions of this article are as follows: we introduce new features of variable-length UNIX command sequences (i.e., weighted occurrence frequencies of different orders) and integrate these features into an extended Markov-chain-based variable-length model. The detection performance of our model is evaluated on three publicly available and free datasets: Schonlau (SEA), Purdue (PU), and Greenberg. The results demonstrate that our model significantly improves the true positive rate (TPR), false positive rate, receiver operator characteristic, and threshold variance compared to the baselines (other Markov-chain-based variable-length models). Furthermore, in terms of the TPR, the proposed method is superior to a state-of-the-art deep learning model that uses a convolutional neural network on the PU and Greenberg datasets and a state-of-the-art sequence-alignment-hidden Markov model on the SEA dataset. Moreover, the proposed method is much more lightweight than the state-of-the-art models in terms of computational and memory complexity, and thus more suitable for real-time masquerade detection. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={With the rapid development of information communication and mobile device technologies, smart devices have become increasingly popular, providing convenience to households and enhancing the level of intelligence in daily life. This trend is also driving innovation and progress in various fields, including healthcare, transportation, and industry. However, as technology continues to proliferate, network security concerns have become increasingly prominent, making the protection of digital life and data security an urgent priority. Intrusion detection has always played an important role in the field of network security. Traditional intrusion detection systems predominantly rely on anomaly detection technology to identify potential intrusions by detecting abnormal patterns in network traffic. With technological advancements, machine learning-based methods have emerged as the cornerstone of modern intrusion detection, enabling more precise identification of abnormal behaviors and potential intrusions by learning the patterns of normal network traffic. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces an innovative intrusion detection model that amalgamates the Attention-CNN-BiLSTM (ACBL) and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) architectures. The ACBL and TCN models excel in processing spatial and temporal features within network traffic data, respectively. This integration harnesses diverse neural network structures to elevate overall model performance and accuracy. Furthermore, a unique approach inspired by dung beetles' natural behavior, incorporating Tent mapping-enhanced Dung Beetle Optimization Algorithm (TDBO), is leveraged for both optimizing feature selection parameters and searching for optimal model hyperparameters. The feature selection parameters obtained from TDBO are then combined with the importance ranking from the Random Forest algorithm, ensuring optimal features can be better selected to enhance model performance. This paper introduces a novel intrusion detection model, the TDBO-ACBLT model, and validates its performance using the UNSW-NW15 dataset. TDBO excels in feature selection compared to common algorithms and achieves superior parameter optimization accuracy over Harris's Hawk Optimization (HHO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Dung Beetle Optimization (DBO). The proposed model achieves higher accuracy than prevalent machine learning models. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Network security has developed as a critical research subject as a result of the Rapid advancements in the development of Internet and communication technologies over the previous decades. The expansion of networks and data has caused cyber-attacks on the systems, making it difficult for network security to detect breaches effectively. Current Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have several flaws, including their inability to prevent attacks on their own, the requirement for a professional engineer to administer them, and the occurrence of false alerts. As a result, a plethora of new attacks are being created, making it harder for network security to properly detect breaches. Despite the best efforts, IDS continues to struggle with increasing detection accuracy while lowering false alarm rates and detecting new intrusions. Therefore, network intrusion detection enhancement by preprocessing and generation of highly reliable algorithms is the main focus nowadays. Machine learning (ML) based IDS systems have recently been implemented as viable solutions for quickly detecting intrusions across the network. In this study, we use a combined data analysis technique with four Robust Machine learning ensemble algorithms, including the Voting Classifier, Bagging Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and Random Forest-based Bagging algorithm along with the proposed Robust genetic ensemble classifier. For each algorithm, a model is created and tested using a Network Dataset. To assess the performance of both algorithms in terms of their ability to anticipate the anomaly occurrence, graphs of performance rates have been evaluated. The suggested algorithm outperformed other methods as it shows the lowest values of mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The experiments were conducted on the Network traffic dataset available on Kaggle, on the Python platform, which has limited samples. The proposed method can be applied in the future with more machine learning ensemble classifiers and deep learning techniques. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.},

abstract={Modern automobiles are equipped with a large number of electronic control units (ECUs) to provide safe, driver assistance and comfortable services. The controller area network (CAN) provides near real-time data transmission between ECUs with adequate reliability for in-vehicle communication. However, the lack of security measures such as authentication and encryption makes the CAN bus vulnerable to cyberattacks, which affect the safety of passengers and the surrounding environment. Detecting attacks on the CAN bus, particularly masquerade attacks, presents significant challenges. It necessitates an intrusion detection system (IDS) that effectively utilizes both CAN ID and payload data to ensure thorough detection and protection against a wide range of attacks, all while operating within the constraints of limited computing resources. This paper introduces an ensemble IDS that combines a gated recurrent unit (GRU) network and a novel autoencoder (AE) model to identify cyberattacks on the CAN bus. AEs are expected to produce higher reconstruction errors for anomalous inputs, making them suitable for anomaly detection. However, vanilla AE models often suffer from overgeneralization, reconstructing anomalies without significant errors, resulting in many false negatives. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel AE called Latent AE, which incorporates a shallow AE into the latent space. The Latent AE model utilizes Cramér's statistic-based feature selection technique and a transformed CAN payload data structure to enhance its efficiency. The proposed ensemble IDS enhances attack detection capabilities by leveraging the best capabilities of independent GRU and Latent AE models, while mitigating the weaknesses associated with each individual model. The evaluation of the IDS on two public datasets, encompassing 13 different attacks, including sophisticated masquerade attacks, demonstrates its superiority over baseline models with near real-time detection latency of 25ms. © 2023 The Author(s)},

abstract={Adversarial attacks have threatened the credibility of machine learning models and cast doubts over the integrity of data. The attacks have created much harm in the fields of computer vision, and natural language processing. In this paper, we focus on the adversarial attack, in particular the poisoning attack, against the network intrusion detection system (NIDS), which is often viewed as the first line of defense against cyber threats. We develop a generative adversarial network (GAN) in AIGAN, which uses deep learning techniques to generate adversarial data and to conduct an anomaly attack on IoT networks. To evaluate the effectiveness of our generator, we measure the similarities between real and fake data using the Jaccard similarity index, in addition comparing the F1-scores from four generic algorithms: multilayer perception, logistic regression, decision tree, random forest. We contrast the performance of ten machine learning classifiers experimented on two real IoT datasets and their fake adversarial samples. Our work highlights a vulnerable side of NIDS created by machine learning when attacked with adversarial perturbation. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Devices which are part of the Internet of Things (IoT) have strong connections; they generate and consume data, which necessitates data transfer among various devices. Smart gadgets collect sensitive information, perform critical tasks, make decisions based on indicator information, and connect and interact with one another quickly. Securing this sensitive data is one of the most vital challenges. A Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is often used to identify and eliminate malicious packets before they can enter a network. This operation must be done at the fog node because the Internet of Things devices are naturally low-power and do not require significant computational resources. In this same context, we offer a novel intrusion detection model capable of deployment at the fog nodes to detect the undesired traffic towards the IoT devices by leveraging features from the UNSW-NB15 dataset. Before continuing with the training of the models, correlation-based feature extraction is done to weed out the extra information contained within the data. This helps in the development of a model that has a low overall computational load. The Tab transformer model is proposed to perform well on the existing dataset and outperforms the traditional Machine Learning ML models developed as well as the previous efforts made on the same dataset. The Tab transformer model was designed only to be capable of handling continuous data. As a result, the proposed model obtained a performance of 98.35% when it came to classifying normal traffic data from abnormal traffic data. However, the model’s performance for predicting attacks involving multiple classes achieved an accuracy of 97.22%. The problem with imbalanced data appears to cause issues with the performance of the underrepresented classes. However, the evaluation results that were given indicated that the proposed model opened new avenues of research on detecting anomalies in fog nodes. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={Researchers have continuously sought effective ways to detect unknown (zero-day) cyberattacks in real time. Most current methods rely on pattern-recognition to identify known threats when they appear. Recently, machine learning anomaly detection tools that train a model on normal network data have been used to identify outliers representing unknown attacks. However, detecting unknown attacks is difficult because of a lack of information on unknown attacks, class imbalance in the data, or failure to accurately detect attacks with normal patterns. To overcome these problems, this study applied data discretization and decision-boundary data point analyses to scrutinize patterns near the thresholds of uncertainty. A novel discretization method was used to effectively train a model for the fuzzy c-means feature analysis of data points at the decision boundary, through which adversarial features were detected and classified based on their entropy. Consequently, it was possible to identify incorrectly detected attack data distributed near the model's decision boundary. The NSL-KDD dataset, which is commonly used to evaluate ML intrusion detection systems, was used to evaluate the proposed method. The results showed that our model successfully identified attacks at the decision boundary and that its performance can be improved through classification. In addition, after classification, it was confirmed that the accuracy of detecting DoS attacks improved by 5 to 7%, Probe by 7 to 10%, R2L by 4 to 7%, and U2R by 1 to 9%, compared with that of existing models. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Cyberattacks are on the rise, making technology companies increasingly prone to data theft. Recent research has focused on constructing cognitive models for traffic anomaly detection in a communication network. Many of these experiments resulted in data packets recorded by technologies like Wireshark. These datasets provide high-dimensional data relating to benign and malicious data packets. Recent research has mostly focused on developing machine learning, and deep learning systems o detect attack data packets in a network. Also, machine learning algorithms are currently trained to detect only known threats. However, with the growth of new cyberattacks and zero-day attacks, current algorithms are unable to detect unknown attacks. This research focuses on detecting rare attacks using transfer learning from a dataset of known attacks. Deep learning outperforms explicit statistical modelling approaches by at least 21% for the dataset used. A preliminary survey of candidate deep learning architectures has been performed before testing for transferability and proposes a Convolutional Neural Network architecture that is 99.65% accurate in classifying attack data packets. The suggested CNN architecture trained with a known attack and then tested its performance on unknown attacks to assess transferability. For this model to extract sufficient information for transferability, the training samples must have more information. Only 20% of the dataset represents current threat data. Several strategies, such as innovative synthetic dataset-based training and bootstrapped dataset training, have been developed to overcome small training sets. A subset of training attacks is determined to optimise learning potential. This study finds training-testing attack pairings with good learning transferability. The most robust and stable relationships are found in DoS attack training-testing pairings. This study also presents model generalisation hypotheses. The dataset features and attack characteristics were analysed using the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) algorithm to validate the results. © 2022. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={The network security analyzers use intrusion detection systems (IDSes) to distinguish malicious traffic from benign ones. The deep learning-based (DL-based) IDSes are proposed to auto-extract high-level features and eliminate the time-consuming and costly signature extraction process. However, this new generation of IDSes still needs to overcome a number of challenges to be employed in practical environments. One of the main issues of an applicable IDS is facing traffic concept drift, which manifests itself as new (i.e., zero-day) attacks, in addition to the changing behavior of benign users/applications. Furthermore, a practical DL-based IDS needs to be conformed to a distributed (i.e., multi-sensor) architecture in order to yield more accurate detections, create a collective attack knowledge based on the observations of different sensors, and also handle big data challenges for supporting high throughput networks. This paper proposes a novel multi-agent network intrusion detection framework to address the above shortcomings, considering a more practical scenario (i.e., online adaptable IDSes). This framework employs continual deep anomaly detectors for adapting each agent to the changing attack/benign patterns in its local traffic. In addition, a federated learning approach is proposed for sharing and exchanging local knowledge between different agents. Furthermore, the proposed framework implements sequential packet labeling for each flow, which provides an attack probability score for the flow by gradually observing each flow packet and updating its estimation. We evaluate the proposed framework by employing different deep models (including CNN-based and LSTM-based) over the CIC-IDS2017 and CSE-CIC-IDS2018 datasets. Through extensive evaluations and experiments, we show that the proposed distributed framework is well adapted to the traffic concept drift. More precisely, our results indicate that the CNN-based models are well suited for continually adapting to the traffic concept drift (i.e., achieving an average detection rate of above 95% while needing just 128 new flows for the updating phase), and the LSTM-based models are a good candidate for sequential packet labeling in practical online IDSes (i.e., detecting intrusions by just observing their first 15 packets). © The Author(s) 2024.},

abstract={In recent years, developed Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) perform a vital function in improving security and anomaly detection. The effectiveness of deep learning-based methods has been proven in extracting better features and more accurate classification than other methods. In this paper, a feature extraction with convolutional neural network on Internet of Things (IoT) called FECNNIoT is designed and implemented to better detect anomalies on the IoT. Also, a binary multi-objective enhance of the Gorilla troops optimizer called BMEGTO is developed for effective feature selection. Finally, the combination of FECNNIoT and BMEGTO and KNN algorithm-based classification technique has led to the presentation of a hybrid method called CNN-BMEGTO-KNN. In the next step, the proposed model is implemented on two benchmark data sets, NSL-KDD and TON-IoT and tested regarding the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score criteria. The proposed CNN-BMEGTO-KNN model has reached 99.99% and 99.86% accuracy on TON-IoT and NSL-KDD datasets, respectively. In addition, the proposed BMEGTO method can identify about 27% and 25% of the effective features of the NSL-KDD and TON-IoT datasets, respectively. © The Author(s) 2024.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) sensor networks are connected systems of physical devices set with actuators, sensors, and communication abilities, allowing them to gather, spread, and exchange information with centralized methods. These networks are essential in numerous businesses, such as healthcare, manufacturing, agriculture, and smart cities, as they deliver real-time observation, data-driven insights, and automation. Threat recognition in IoT sensor networks is a vital feature of safeguarding the protection and consistency of interconnected systems in the IoT. As IoT sensor networks endure to increase across various industries, the vulnerability to malicious actions and cyber-attacks increases. Threat recognition utilizing deep learning (DL) leverages neural networks to examine complex patterns and anomalies in data, permitting the identification of potential safety threats. DL techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs) excel at learning complex representations of data and feature extraction, making them suitable for identifying sophisticated attacks in different fields, including cybersecurity. This research develops a Hybrid Sine-Cosine Chimp Optimization Feature Selection with a Deep Learning (HSCCOFS-DL) approach for Threat Recognition in IoT Sensor Networks. The foremost aim of the HSCCOFS-DL system lies in the automated detection of threats using DL models. To accomplish this, the HSCCOFS-DL approach undergoes a data normalization process. Besides, the selection of features can be performed using the HSCCO algorithm. Meanwhile, the symmetrical autoencoder (SAE) technique effectively classifies threats. Finally, the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) can be applied to the selection of the hyperparameter of the SAE system. The experimental assessment of the HSCCOFS-DL technique takes place on a benchmark dataset. The simulation results indicated that the HSCCOFS-DL approach attains enhanced performance over other methods. © 2024 The Authors},

abstract={Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) play a critical role in maintaining the security and integrity of computer networks. These systems are designed to detect and respond to anomalous activities that may indicate malicious intent or unauthorized access. The need for robust NIDS solutions has never been more pressing in today's digital landscape, characterized by constantly evolving cyber threats. Deploying effective NIDS can be challenging, particularly in accurately identifying network anomalies amid the ever-increasing sophisticated and difficult-to-detect cyber threats. The motivation for our research stems from the recognition that while NIDS studies have made significant strides, there remains a crucial need for more effective and accurate methods to detect network anomalies. Commonly used features in NIDS studies include network logs, with some studies exploring text-based features such as payload. However, traditional machine and deep learning models may need to be improved in learning jointly from tabular and text-based features. Here, we present a new approach that integrates both tabular and text-based features to improve the performance of NIDS. Our research aims to address the existing limitations of NIDS and contribute to the development of more reliable and efficient network security solutions by introducing more effective and accurate methods for detecting network anomalies. Our internal experiments have revealed that the deep learning approach utilizing tabular features produces favourable results, whereas the pre-trained transformer approach needs to perform sufficiently. Hence, our proposed approach, which integrates both feature types using deep learning and pre-trained transformer approaches, achieves superior performance. These findings indicate that integrating both feature types using deep learning and pre-trained transformer approaches can significantly improve the accuracy of network anomaly detection. Moreover, our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, F1-score, and recall on commonly used NIDS datasets consisting of ISCX-IDS2012, UNSW-NB15, and CIC-IDS2017, with F1-scores of 99.80%, 92.37%, and 99.69%, respectively, indicating its effectiveness in detecting network anomalies. © 2023 The Authors.

abstract={The advent of computer networks and the internet has drastically altered the means by which we share information and interact with each other. However, this technological advancement has also created opportunities for malevolent behavior, with individuals exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access to confidential data, obstruct activity, etc. To this end, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are needed to filter malicious traffic and prevent common attacks. In the past, these systems relied on a fixed set of rules or comparisons with previous attacks. However, with the increased availability of computational power and data, machine learning has emerged as a promising solution for this task. While many systems now use this methodology in real-time for a reactive approach to mitigation, we explore the potential of configuring it as a proactive time series prediction. In this work, we delve into this possibility further. More specifically, we convert a classic IDS dataset to a time series format and use predictive models to forecast forthcoming malign packets. We propose a new architecture combining convolutional neural networks, long short-term memory networks, and attention. The findings indicate that our model performs strongly, exhibiting an F1 score and AUC that are within margins of 1% and 3%, respectively, when compared to conventional real-time detection. Also, our architecture achieves an ∼8% F1 score improvement compared to an LSTM (long short-term memory) model. © 2024 by the authors.},

abstract={Software-Defined Networks (SDN) refers to a revolutionary pattern that separates the control plane from the data plane, converting the idea of a software-driven network. Cyber attackers had a target towards the SDN controllers to subdue the control planes that can be regarded as the SDN brain. It offers a plethora of functionalities like regulating flow control to routers or switches in the data plane below through southbound Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and application logic and business in the application plane above through northbound APIs for implementing sophisticated networks. But the control plane is a tempting prospect for security attacks from adversaries due to its centralization features. The main concern is information safety in the network. To prevent the loss of extremely useful information, the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has been formulated for recognizing the outbreak of a stream of attacks and notifying system administrators granting network security. With this motivation, this article develops a Hybrid Metaheuristics with Deep Learning Enabled Cyberattack Prevention (HMDL-CAP) model in SDN. The presented HMDL-CAP model initially carries out data preprocessing to scale the input data. Then,spiral dynamics optimization-based feature selection (SDOFS) algorithm is utilized for optimum selection of feature subsets. Next, hybrid convolutional neural network with recurrent neural network (HCRNN) model is applied to detect intrusions. As hyperparameter tuning is important, pelican optimization algorithm (POA) is used to tune the HRCNN parameters. To assess the experimental outcomes of the proposed model, a series of experiments were performed using benchmark dataset. The comparison study shows the promising performance of the HMDL-CAP model over recent models. © 2024, Strojarski Facultet. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Abstract: Intrusion detection systems have been proposed for the detection of botnet attacks. Various types of centralized or distributed cloud-based machine learning and deep learning models have been suggested. However, the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) has brought about a huge increase in connected devices, necessitating a different approach. In this paper, we propose to perform detection on IoT-edge devices. The suggested architecture includes an anomaly intrusion detection system in the application layer of IoT-edge devices, arranged in software-defined networks. IoT-edge devices request information from the software-defined networks controller about their own behaviour in the network. This behaviour is represented by communication graphs and is novel for IoT networks. This representation better characterizes the behaviour of the device than the traditional analysis of network traffic, with a lower volume of information. Botnet attack scenarios are simulated with the IoT-23 dataset. Experimental results show that attacks are detected with high accuracy using a deep learning model with low device memory requirements and significant storage reduction for training.

abstract={The Internet of bio-nano things (IoBNT) is an emerging paradigm employing nanoscale (~1-100 nm) biological transceivers to collect in vivo signaling information from the human body and communicate it to healthcare providers over the Internet. Bio-nano-things (BNT) offer external actuation of in-body molecular communication (MC) for targeted drug delivery to otherwise inaccessible parts of the human tissue. BNTs are inter-connected using chemical diffusion channels, forming an in vivo bio-nano network, connected to an external ex vivo environment such as the Internet using bio-cyber interfaces. Bio-luminescent bio-cyber interfacing (BBI) has proven to be promising in realizing IoBNT systems due to their non-obtrusive and low-cost implementation. BBI security, however, is a key concern during practical implementation since Internet connectivity exposes the interfaces to external threat vectors, and accurate classification of anomalous BBI traffic patterns is required to offer mitigation. However, parameter complexity and underlying intricate correlations among BBI traffic characteristics limit the use of existing machine-learning (ML) based anomaly detection methods typically requiring hand-crafted feature designing. To this end, the present work investigates the employment of deep learning (DL) algorithms allowing dynamic and scalable feature engineering to discriminate between normal and anomalous BBI traffic. During extensive validation using singular and multi-dimensional models on the generated dataset, our hybrid convolutional and recurrent ensemble (CNN + LSTM) reported an accuracy of approximately ~93.51% over other deep and shallow structures. Furthermore, employing a hybrid DL network allowed automated extraction of normal as well as temporal features in BBI data, eliminating manual selection and crafting of input features for accurate prediction. Finally, we recommend deployment primitives of the extracted optimal classifier in conventional intrusion detection systems as well as evolving non-Von Neumann architectures for real-time anomaly detection.},

abstract={In the domain of network security, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) play a vital role in data security. While the utilization of the internet amongst consumers is increasing on a daily basis, the significance of security and privacy preservation of system alerts, due to malicious actions, is also increasing. IDS is a widely executed system that protects computer networks from attacks. For the identification of unknown attacks and anomalies, several Machine Learning (ML) approaches such as Neural Networks (NNs) are explored. However, in real-world applications, the classification performances of these approaches are fluctuant with distinct databases. The major reason for this drawback is the presence of some ineffective or redundant features. So, the current study proposes the Network Intrusion Detection System using a Lion Optimization Feature Selection with a Deep Learning (NIDS-LOFSDL) approach to remedy the aforementioned issue. The NIDS-LOFSDL technique follows the concept of FS with a hyperparameter-tuned DL model for the recognition of intrusions. For the purpose of FS, the NIDS-LOFSDL method uses the LOFS technique, which helps in improving the classification results. Furthermore, the attention-based bi-directional long short-term memory (ABiLSTM) system is applied for intrusion detection. In order to enhance the intrusion detection performance of the ABiLSTM algorithm, the gorilla troops optimizer (GTO) is deployed so as to perform hyperparameter tuning. Since trial-and-error manual hyperparameter tuning is a tedious process, the GTO-based hyperparameter tuning process is performed, which demonstrates the novelty of the work. In order to validate the enhanced solution of the NIDS-LOFSDL system in terms of intrusion detection, a comprehensive range of experiments was performed. The simulation values confirm the promising results of the NIDS-LOFSDL system compared to existing DL methodologies, with a maximum accuracy of 96.88% and 96.92% on UNSW-NB15 and AWID datasets, respectively. © 2023 by the author.},

abstract={With the rapid expansion and widespread adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT), maintaining secure connections among active devices can be challenging. Since IoT devices are limited in power and storage, they cannot performcomplex tasks, which makes them vulnerable to different types of attacks. Given the volume of data generated daily, detecting anomalous behavior can be demanding. However, machine learning (ML) algorithms have proven successful in extracting complex patterns from big data, which has led to active applications in IoT. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis, including 4 ML algorithms and 3 neural networks (NNs), and propose a pipeline which analyzes the influence data reduction (loss) has on the performance of these algorithms. We use random undersampling as a data reduction technique, which simulates reduced network traffic data. The pipeline investigates several degrees of data loss. The results show that models trained on the original data distribution obtain accuracy that verges on 100%. XGBoost performs best from the classic ML algorithms. From the deep learning models, the 2-layered NN provides excellent results and has sufficient depth for practical application. On the other hand, when the models are trained on the undersampled data, there is a decrease in performance, most notably in the case of NNs. The most prominent change is seen in the 4-layered NN, where the model trained on the original dataset detects attacks with a success of 93.53%, whereas the model trained on the maximally reduced data has a success of only 39.39%. © 2023, Radioengineering.

abstract={Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) have entered an era of modernization enabled by the recent progress in Information Technologies (IT), particularly the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). This enables better automation of industrial processes but now exposes the ICSs to cyber-attacks that exploit the IIoT vulnerabilities. Thus, to ensure ICSs security, numerous research works have focused on designing Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPSs), and deep learning has recently received considerable attention, as it has the potential to improve detection accuracy. However, most of the proposed deep learning solutions focus only on the model's accuracy without considering latency, which is an essential requirement in many ICSs. The novelty of this paper is the time complexity analysis of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and the design of a low latency and robust deep learning-based collaborative IDPS. The proposed architecture employs two classification models. In the first model, a lightweight DNN is used to perform a binary classification, i.e., normal or attack, which ensures rapid intrusion detection. A second model ensures the identification of the type of attacks by performing a multi-class classification of the detected anomaly, which is handled by a robust and complex DNN in order to achieve higher accuracy. This research also proposes intrusion response measures to deal with detected attacks, first after the anomaly detection, and then after the identification of the attack type. An experimental evaluation has been provided using various detection features, datasets, DNN algorithms, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Anomaly detection in internet of things network traffic is a critical aspect of intrusion and attack detection, in which a deviation from typical behavior signals the existence of malicious or inadvertent assaults, faults, flaws, and other issues. The necessity to examine a large number of security events to identify anomalous behavior of smart devices adds to the urgency of addressing the challenge of picking machine-learning and deep learning models for identifying anomalies in network traffic. For the challenge of binary data categorization, a software implementation of an intrusion detection system based on supervised-learning algorithms has been completed. The UNSWNB15 open dataset, which contains 2,540,044 records - vectors of TCP/IP network connection signals and their associated class labels are used to train and test the system. This research compares different machine-learning models and proposes CNNBiLSTM hybrid model for IoT network intrusion detection. The metrics for measuring the quality of classification and the running duration of algorithms for different ratios of train and test samples are the result of the built framework testing © 2023, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={In recent years, anomaly detection and machine learning for intrusion detection systems have been used to detect anomalies on Internet of Things networks. These systems rely on machine and deep learning to improve the detection accuracy. However, the robustness of the model depends on the number of datasamples available, quality of the data, and the distribution of the data classes. In the present paper, we focused specifically on the amount of data and class imbalanced since both parameters are key in IoT due to the fact that network traffic is increasing exponentially. For this reason, we propose a framework that uses a big data methodology with Hadoop–Spark to train and test multi-class and binary classification with one-vs-rest strategy for intrusion detection using the entire BoT IoT dataset. Thus, we evaluate all the algorithms available in Hadoop–Spark in terms of accuracy and processing time. In addition, since the BoT IoT dataset used is highly imbalanced, we also improve the accuracy for detecting minority classes by generating more datasamples using a Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network (CTGAN). In general, our proposed model outperforms other published models including our previous model. Using our proposed methodology, the F1-score of one of the minority class, i.e., Theft attack was improved from 42% to 99%. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={Today, deep learning approaches are widely used to build Intrusion Detection Systems for securing IoT environments. However, the models’ hidden and complex nature raises various concerns, such as trusting the model output and understanding why the model made certain decisions. Researchers generally publish their proposed model’s settings and performance results based on a specific dataset and a classification model but do not report the proposed model’s output and findings. Similarly, many researchers suggest an IDS solution by focusing only on a single benchmark dataset and classifier. Such solutions are prone to generating inaccurate and biased results. This paper overcomes these limitations in previous work by analyzing various benchmark datasets and various individual and hybrid deep learning classifiers towards finding the best IDS solution for IoT that is efficient, lightweight, and comprehensive in detecting network anomalies. We also showed the model’s localized predictions and analyzed the top contributing features impacting the global performance of deep learning models. This paper aims to extract the aggregate knowledge from various datasets and classifiers and analyze the commonalities to avoid any possible bias in results and increase the trust and transparency of deep learning models. We believe this paper’s findings will help future researchers build a comprehensive IDS based on well-performing classifiers and utilize the aggregated knowledge and the minimum set of significantly contributing features. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={The growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to a significant rise in cyber attacks and an expanded attack surface for the average consumer. In order to protect consumers and infrastructure, research into detecting malicious IoT activity must be of the highest priority. Security research in this area has two key issues: the lack of datasets for training artificial intelligence (AI)-based intrusion detection models and the fact that most existing datasets concentrate only on one type of network traffic. Thus, this study introduces Dragon_Pi, an intrusion detection dataset designed for IoT devices based on side-channel power consumption data. Dragon_Pi comprises a collection of normal and under-attack power consumption traces from separate testbeds featuring a DragonBoard 410c and a Raspberry Pi. Dragon_Slice is trained on this dataset; it is an unsupervised convolutional autoencoder (CAE) trained exclusively on held-out normal slices from Dragon_Pi for anomaly detection. The Dragon_Slice network has two iterations in this study. The original achieves 0.78 AUC without post-processing and 0.876 AUC with post-processing. A second iteration of Dragon_Slice, utilising dropout to further impede the CAE’s ability to reconstruct anomalies, outperforms the original network with a raw AUC of 0.764 and a post-processed AUC of 0.89. © 2024 by the authors.},

abstract={One of the significant aspects of our digital world is that data are literally everywhere, and it is increasing. On the other hand, the number of cyberattacks aiming to seize this data and use it illegally is increasing at an exponential rate, and this is the challenge. Therefore, intrusion detection systems (IDS) have attracted considerable interest from researchers and industries. In this regard, machine learning (ML) techniques are playing a pivotal role as they put the responsibility of analyzing enormous amounts of data, finding patterns, classifying intrusions, and solving issues on computers instead of humans. This paper implements two separate classification layers of ML-based algorithms with the recently published NF-UQ-NIDS-v2 dataset, preprocessing two volumes of sample records (100 k and 10 million), utilizing MinMaxScaler, LabelEncoder, selecting superlative features by recursive feature elimination, normalizing the data, and optimizing hyper-parameters for classical algorithms and neural networks. With a small dataset volume, the results of the classical algorithms layer show high detection accuracy rates for support vector (98.26%), decision tree (98.78%), random forest (99.07%), K-nearest neighbors (98.16%), CatBoost (99.04%), and gradient boosting (98.80%). In addition, the layer of neural network algorithms has proven to be a very powerful technology when using deep learning, particularly due to its unique ability to effectively handle enormous amounts of data and detect hidden correlations and patterns; it showed high detection results, which were (98.87%) for long short-term memory and (98.56%) for convolutional neural networks. © 2023, The Author(s).},

abstract={Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are essential in the field of cybersecurity because they protect networks from a wide range of online threats. The goal of this research is to meet the urgent need for small-footprint, highly-adaptable Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) that can identify anomalies. The NSL-KDD dataset is used in the study; it is a sizable collection comprising 43 variables with the label’s “attack” and “level.” It proposes a novel approach to intrusion detection based on the combination of channel attention and convolutional neural networks (CNN). Furthermore, this dataset makes it easier to conduct a thorough assessment of the suggested intrusion detection strategy. Furthermore, maintaining operating efficiency while improving detection accuracy is the primary goal of this work. Moreover, typical NIDS examines both risky and typical behavior using a variety of techniques. On the NSL-KDD dataset, our CNN-based approach achieves an astounding 99.728% accuracy rate when paired with channel attention. Compared to previous approaches such as ensemble learning, CNN, RBM (Boltzmann machine), ANN, hybrid auto-encoders with CNN, MCNN, and ANN, and adaptive algorithms, our solution significantly improves intrusion detection performance. Moreover, the results highlight the effectiveness of our suggested method in improving intrusion detection precision, signifying a noteworthy advancement in this field. Subsequent efforts will focus on strengthening and expanding our approach in order to counteract growing cyberthreats and adjust to changing network circumstances. © 2024 Tech Science Press.

abstract={With the significant increase in cyber-attacks and attempts to gain unauthorised access to systems and information, Network Intrusion-Detection Systems (NIDSs) have become essential detection tools. Anomaly-based systems use machine learning techniques to distinguish between normal and anomalous traffic. They do this by using training datasets that have been previously gathered and labelled, allowing them to learn to detect anomalies in future data. However, such datasets can be accidentally or deliberately contaminated, compromising the performance of NIDS. This has been the case of the UGR’16 dataset, in which, during the labelling process, botnet-type attacks were not identified in the subset intended for training. This paper addresses the mislabelling problem of real network traffic datasets by introducing a novel methodology that (i) allows analysing the quality of a network traffic dataset by identifying possible hidden or unidentified anomalies and (ii) selects the ideal subset of data to optimise the performance of the anomaly detection model even in the presence of hidden attacks erroneously labelled as normal network traffic. To this end, a two-step process that makes incremental use of the training dataset is proposed. Experiments conducted on the contaminated UGR’16 dataset in conjunction with the state-of-the-art NIDS, Kitsune, conclude with the feasibility of the approach to reveal observations of hidden botnet-based attacks on this dataset. © 2024 by the authors.},

abstract={the CAN captures. Our contributions aim to facilitate appropriate benchmarking and needed comparability in the CAN IDS research field.
Although ubiquitous in modern vehicles, Controller Area Networks (CANs) lack basic security properties and are easily exploitable. A rapidly growing field of CAN security research has emerged that seeks to detect intrusions or anomalies on CANs. Producing vehicular CAN data with a variety of intrusions is a difficult task for most researchers as it requires expensive assets and deep expertise. To illuminate this task, we introduce the first comprehensive guide to the existing open CAN intrusion detection system (IDS) datasets. We categorize attacks on CANs including fabrication (adding frames, e.g., flooding or targeting and ID), suspension (removing an ID’s frames), and masquerade attacks (spoofed frames sent in lieu of suspended ones). We provide a quality analysis of each dataset; an enumeration of each datasets’ attacks, benefits, and drawbacks; categorization as real vs. simulated CAN data and real vs. simulated attacks; whether the data is raw CAN data or signal-translated; number of vehicles/CANs; quantity in terms of time; and finally a suggested use case of each dataset. State-of-the-art public CAN IDS datasets are limited to real fabrication (simple message injection) attacks and simulated attacks often in synthetic data, lacking fidelity. In general, the physical effects of attacks on the vehicle are not verified in the available datasets. Only one dataset provides signal-translated data but is missing a corresponding “raw” binary version. This issue pigeon-holes CAN IDS research into testing on limited and often inappropriate data (usually with attacks that are too easily detectable to truly test the method). The scarcity of appropriate data has stymied comparability and reproducibility of results for researchers. As our primary contribution, we present the Real ORNL Automotive Dynamometer (ROAD) CAN IDS dataset, consisting of over 3.5 hours of one vehicle’s CAN data. ROAD contains ambient data recorded during a diverse set of activities, and attacks of increasing stealth with multiple variants and instances of real (i.e. non-simulated) fuzzing, fabrication, unique advanced attacks, and simulated masquerade attacks. To facilitate a benchmark for CAN IDS methods that require signal-translated inputs, we also provide the signal time series format for many of Copyright: © 2024 Verma et al.},

abstract={Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems are crucial for modern industrial processes and securing them against increasing cyber threats is a significant challenge. This study presents an advanced method for bolstering SCADA security by employing a modified hybrid deep learning model. A key innovation in this work is integrating the Self-similarity Hurst parameter into the dataset alongside a CNN-LSTM model, significantly boosting the Intrusion Detection System's (IDS) capabilities. The Hurst parameter, which quantifies the self-similarity in a dataset, is instrumental in detecting anomalies. Our in-depth analysis of the CICIDS2017 dataset sheds light on contemporary attack patterns and network traffic behaviors. The CNN-LSTM architecture was substantially altered by adding multiple convolutional layers with progressively increasing filters, batch normalization for stable training, and dropout layers for regularization. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied for dimensionality reduction, thereby optimizing the dataset. Test results demonstrate the superior performance of the model incorporating the Hurst parameter, achieving 95.21% accuracy and 82.59% recall, significantly surpassing the standard model. The inclusion of the Hurst parameter marks a substantial advancement in identifying emerging threats, while architectural improvements to the CNN-LSTM model led to more robust and accurate intrusion detection in industrial control settings. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={With the increasing rate and types of cyber attacks against information systems and communication infrastructures, many tools are needed to detect and mitigate against such attacks, for example, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). Unfortunately, traditional Signature-based IDSs (SIDSs) perform poorly against previously unseen adversarial attacks. Anomaly-based IDSs (AIDSs) use Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) approaches to overcome these limitations. However, AIDS performance can be poor when trained on imbalanced datasets. To address the challenge of AIDS performance caused by these unbalanced training datasets, generative adversarial models are proposed to obtain adversarial attacks from one side and analyse their quality from another. According to extensive usage and reliability criteria for generative adversarial models in different disciplines, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Bidirectional GAN (BiGAN), and Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) are employed to serve AIDS. The authors have extensively assessed their abilities and robustness to deliver high-quality attacks for AIDS. AIDSs are constructed, trained, and tuned based on these models to measure their impacts. The authors have employed two datasets: NSL-KDD and CICIDS-2017 for generalisation purposes, where ML and DL approaches are utilised to implement AIDSs. Their results show that the WGAN model outperformed GANs and BiGAN models in binary and multiclass classifications for both datasets. © 2023 The Authors.

abstract={Cloud computing (CC) is an internet-enabled environment that provides computing services such as networking, databases, and servers to clients and organizations in a cost-effective manner. Despite the benefits rendered by CC, its security remains a prominent concern to overcome. An intrusion detection system (IDS) is generally used to detect both normal and anomalous behavior in networks. The design of IDS using a machine learning (ML) technique comprises a series of methods that can learn patterns from data and forecast the outcomes consequently. In this background, the current study designs a novel multi-objective seagull optimization algorithm with a deep learning-enabled vulnerability detection (MOSOA-DLVD) technique to secure the cloud platform. The MOSOA-DLVD technique uses the feature selection (FS) method and hyperparameter tuning strategy to identify the presence of vulnerabilities or attacks in the cloud infrastructure. Primarily, the FS method is implemented using the MOSOA technique. Furthermore, the MOSOA-DLVD technique uses a deep belief network (DBN) method for intrusion detection and its classification. In order to improve the detection outcomes of the DBN algorithm, the sooty tern optimization algorithm (STOA) is applied for the hyperparameter tuning process. The performance of the proposed MOSOA-DLVD system was validated with extensive simulations upon a benchmark IDS dataset. The improved intrusion detection results of the MOSOA-DLVD approach with a maximum accuracy of 99.34% establish the proficiency of the model compared with recent methods. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={In many commercial and public sectors, the Internet of Things (IoT) is deeply embedded. Cyber security threats aimed at compromising the security, reliability, or accessibility of data are a serious concern for the IoT. Due to the collection of data from several IoT devices, the IoT presents unique challenges for detecting anomalous behavior. It is the responsibility of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to ensure the security of a network by reporting any suspicious activity. By identifying failed and successful attacks, IDS provides a more comprehensive security capability. A reliable and efficient anomaly detection system is essential for IoT-driven decision-making. Using deep learning-based anomaly detection, this study proposes an IoT anomaly detection system capable of identifying relevant characteristics in a controlled environment. These factors are used by the classifier to improve its ability to identify fraudulent IoT data. For efficient outlier detection, the author proposed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based Attention Mechanism (ACNN-LSTM). As part of the ACNN-LSTM model, CNN units are deployed with an attention mechanism to avoid memory loss and gradient dispersion. Using the N-BaIoT and IoT-23 datasets, the model is verified. According to the N-BaIoT dataset, the overall accuracy is 99%, and precision, recall, and F1-score are also 0.99. In addition, the IoT-23 dataset shows a commendable accuracy of 99%. In terms of accuracy and recall, it scored 0.99, while the F1-score was 0.98. The LSTM model with attention achieved an accuracy of 95%, while the CNN model achieved an accuracy of 88%. According to the loss graph, attention-based models had lower loss values, indicating that they were more effective at detecting anomalies. In both the N-BaIoT and IoT-23 datasets, the receiver operating characteristic and area under the curve (ROC-AUC) graphs demonstrated exceptional accuracy of 99% to 100% for the Attention-based CNN and LSTM models. This indicates that these models are capable of making precise predictions. © 2023 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Intrusion detection systems utilize the analysis of log data to effectively detect anomalies. However, detecting anomalies quickly and effectively in large and heterogeneous log data can be challenging. To address this difficulty, this study proposes the GLSTM (Graph-based Long Short-Term Memory) framework, a graph-based deep learning model that analyzes log data to detect cyber-attacks rapidly and effectively. The framework involves standardizing the complex and diverse log data, training this data on an artificial intelligence model, and detecting anomalies. Initially, the complex and diverse log data is transformed into graph data using Node2Vec, enabling efficient and rapid analysis on the artificial intelligence model. Subsequently, these graph data are trained using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), Bi-LSTM, and GRU(Gated Recurrent Unit) deep learning algorithms. The proposed framework is tested using Hadoop’s HDFS dataset, collected from different systems and heterogeneous sources, as well as the BGL and IMDB datasets. Experimental results on the selected datasets demonstrate high levels of success. © 2023 Akif AKGUL. All rights reserved},

abstract={The Internet of things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm that integrates devices and services to collect real-time data from surroundings and process the information at a very high speed to make a decision. Despite several advantages, the resource-constrained and heterogeneous nature of IoT networks makes them a favorite target for cybercriminals. A single successful attempt of network intrusion can compromise the complete IoT network which can lead to unauthorized access to the valuable information of consumers and industries. To overcome the security challenges of IoT networks, this article proposes a lightweight deep autoencoder (DAE) based cyberattack detection framework. The proposed approach learns the normal and anomalous data patterns to identify the various types of network intrusions. The most significant feature of the proposed technique is its lower complexity which is attained by reducing the number of operations. To optimally train the proposed DAE, a range of hyperparameters was determined through extensive experiments that ensure higher attack detection accuracy. The efficacy of the suggested framework is evaluated via two standard and open-source datasets. The proposed DAE achieved the accuracies of 98.86%, and 98.26% for NSL-KDD, 99.32%, and 98.79% for the UNSW-NB15 dataset in binary class and multi-class scenarios. The performance of the suggested attack detection framework is also compared with several state-of-the-art intrusion detection schemes. Experimental outcomes proved the promising performance of the proposed scheme for cyberattack detection in IoT networks. © 2023 CRL Publishing. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Detecting anomalous inputs is essential in many mission-critical systems in various domains, particularly cybersecurity. In particular, deep neural network-based anomaly detection methods have been successful for anomaly detection tasks with the recent advancements in deep learning technology. Nevertheless, the existing methods have considered somewhat idealized problems where it is enough to learn a single detector based on a single dataset. In this paper, we consider a more practical problem where multiple hosts in an organization collect their input data, while data sharing among the hosts is prohibitive due to security reasons, and only a few of them have experienced abnormal inputs. Furthermore, the data distribution of the hosts can be skewed; for example, a particular type of input can be observed by a limited subset of hosts. We propose the federated hypersphere classifier (FHC), which is a new anomaly detection method based on an improved hypersphere classifier suited for running in the federated learning framework to perform anomaly detection in such an environment. Our experiments with image and network intrusion detection datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods trained in a host-wise fashion by learning a consensus model as if we have accessed the input data from all hosts but without communicating such data. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Cyberattacks are developing gradually sophisticated, requiring effective intrusion detection systems (IDSs) for monitoring computer resources and creating reports on anomalous or suspicious actions. With the popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, the security of IoT networks is developing a vital problem. Because of the huge number and varied kinds of IoT devices, it can be challenging task for protecting the IoT framework utilizing a typical IDS. The typical IDSs have their restrictions once executed to IoT networks because of resource constraints and complexity. Therefore, this paper presents a new Blockchain Assisted Intrusion Detection System using Differential Flower Pollination with Deep Learning (BAIDS-DFPDL) model in IoT Environment. The presented BAIDS-DFPDL model mainly focuses on the identification and classification of intrusions in the IoT environment. To accomplish this, the presented BAIDS-DFPDL model follows blockchain (BC) technology for effective and secure data transmission among the agents. Besides, the presented BAIDS-DFPDL model designs Differential Flower Pollination based feature selection (DFPFS) technique to elect features. Finally, sailfish optimization (SFO) with Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) model is applied for effectual recognition of intrusions. The simulation results on benchmark dataset exhibit the enhanced performance of the BAIDS-DFPDL model over other models on the recognition of intrusions. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

abstract={To address the problem of poor detection performance of existing intrusion detection methods in the environment of high-dimensional massive data with uneven class distribution, a deep learning-based anomaly traffic detection method in cloud computing environment is proposed. First, the fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm is introduced and is combined with the general regression neural network (GRNN) to cluster the samples to be classified in the original space by FCM. Then, the GRNN model is trained and the center point is updated using the sample closest to the FCM clustering center until a stable cluster center is obtained. The parameters in FCM-GRNN are optimized using the global optimization feature of the modified fruit fly optimization algorithm (MFOA), and the optimal spread value is found using the three-dimensional search method through an iterative search. Finally, experiments are conducted based on the KDD CUP99 dataset, and the results demonstrate that the detection rate (DR) and false alarm rate (FAR) of the proposed FCM-MFOA-GRNN method are 91% and 1.176%, respectively, which are better than those of the comparison methods. Therefore, the proposed method has good anomaly traffic detection ability. © 2022 Junjie Cen and Yongbo Li.},

abstract={Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) is a recent voice communication technology and due to its variety of calling capabilities, the system is expected to fuel the market value even further in the next five years. However, there are serious concerns since VoIP systems are frequently been attacked. According to recent security alliance reports, malicious activities have increased largely during the current pandemic against VoIP and other vulnerable networks. This hence implies that existing models are not sufficiently reliable since most of them do not have a hundred percent detection rate. In this paper, a review of our most recent Intrusion Detection & Prevention Systems (IDPS) developed is proposed together with a comparative analysis. The final work consisted of ten models which addressed flood intentional attacks to mitigate VoIP attacks. The methodological approaches of the studies included the quantitative and scientific paradigms, for which several instruments (comparative analysis and experiments) were used. Six prevention models were developed using three sorting methods combined with either a modified galloping algorithm or an extended quadratic algorithm. The seventh IDPS was designed by improving an existing genetic algorithm (e-GAP) and the eighth model is a novel deep learning method known as the Closest Adjacent Neighbour (CAN). Finally, for a better comparative analysis of AI-based algorithms, a Deep Analysis of the Intruder Tracing (DAIT) model using a bottom-up approach was developed to address the issues of processing time, effectiveness, and efficiency which were challenges when addressing very large datasets of incoming messages. This novel method prevented intruders to access a system without authorization and avoided any anomaly filtering at the firewall with a minimum processing time. Results revealed that the DAIT and the e-GAP models are very efficient and gave better results when benchmarking with models. These two models obtained an F-score of 98.83%, a detection rate of 100%, a false rate of 0%, an accuracy of 98.7%, and finally a processing time per message of 0.092 ms and 0.094 ms respectively. When comparing with previous models in the literature from which it is specified that detection rates obtained are 95.5% and false-positive alarm of around 1.8%, except for one recent machine learning-based model having a detection rate of 100% and a processing time of 0.53 ms, the DAIT and the e-GAP models give better results. © 2021 MECS.},

abstract={In today’s digital era, most electrical gadgets have become smart, and the great majority of them can connect to the internet. The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network comprised of interconnected items. Cloud-based IoT infrastructures are vulnerable to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Despite the fact that these devices may be accessed from anywhere, they are vulnerable to assault and compromise. DDoS attacks pose a significant threat to network security and operational integrity. DDoS assault in which infected botnets of networks hit the victim’s PC from several systems across the internet, is one of the most popular. In this paper, three prominent datasets: UNSW-NB 15, UNSW-2018 IoT Botnet and recent Edge IIoT are using in an Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection system(AIDS) to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks. AIDS employ machine learning methods and Deep Learning (DL) for attack mitigation. The suggested work employed different types of machine learning and Deep Learning (DL): Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Multi-layer perceptron (MLP), deep Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Long Term Short Memory (LSTM) methods to identify DDoS attacks. Both of these methods are contrasted by the fact that the database stores the trained signatures. As a results, RF shows a promising performance with 100% accuracy and a minimum false positive on testing both datasets UNSW-NB 15 and UNSW-2018 Botnet. In addition, the results for a realistic Edge IIoT dataset show a good performance in accuracy for RF 98.79% and for deep learning LSTM with 99.36% in minimum time compared with other results for multi-class detection. © IBERAMIA and the authors.},

abstract={Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) play a pivotal role in safeguarding critical digital infrastructures against cyber threats. Machine learning-based detection models applied in NIDS are prevalent today. However, the effectiveness of these machine learning-based models is often limited by the evolving and sophisticated nature of intrusion techniques as well as the lack of diverse and updated training samples. In this research, a novel approach for enhancing the performance of an NIDS through the integration of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is proposed. By harnessing the power of GANs in generating synthetic network traffic data that closely mimics real-world network behavior, we address a key challenge associated with NIDS training datasets, which is the data scarcity. Three distinct GAN models (Vanilla GAN, Wasserstein GAN and Conditional Tabular GAN) are implemented in this work to generate authentic network traffic patterns specifically tailored to represent the anomalous activity. We demonstrate how this synthetic data resampling technique can significantly improve the performance of the NIDS model for detecting such activity. By conducting comprehensive experiments using the CIC-IDS2017 benchmark dataset, augmented with GAN-generated data, we offer empirical evidence that shows the effectiveness of our proposed approach. Our findings show that the integration of GANs into NIDS can lead to enhancements in intrusion detection performance for attacks with limited training data, making it a promising avenue for bolstering the cybersecurity posture of organizations in an increasingly interconnected and vulnerable digital landscape. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Zero-day attack detection solutions aim to proactively identify unknown threats targeting valuable assets within a given system. While many Intrusion Detection System (IDS) solutions leverage learning techniques to build novel attack detection systems, they often focus on enhancing accuracy for specific attack types, overlooking the potential for multiple attack scenarios. Therefore, we introduce a novel framework for detecting zero-day attacks that evade current detection systems. Our framework enhances attack identification and qualification through a hybrid learning approach, where supervised learning ensures detection of known attacks and unsupervised learning. It encompasses intrusion detection phases from data collection to new attack class detection by identifying anomalies in real-time network flow data. Unsupervised learning, which involves grouping similar data points into clusters, establishes minimum distances within these clusters. This process triggers cluster division when certain thresholds are reached. Finally, an online supervised learning process validates our approach's effectiveness in identifying anomalies associated with zero-day attack flows. This approach significantly reduces the False Detection Rate (FDR) without solely focusing on optimizing machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms hyper-parameters. We evaluated our framework on two datasets: one from a real industrial context at IBM and the NSL-KDD dataset. The results demonstrate our framework's ability to detect anomalies in previously zero-day attack targets. On average, we identified 71 anomalous flows per target, achieving an overall average online learning accuracy of 98.4% for the IBM dataset and 96.6% for the NSL-KDD dataset, thereby validating the detection of these new attack scenarios. © 2024 The Author(s)},

abstract={Security in smart cities is a challenging issue in urban environments as they depend upon interconnected technologies and data for effective services. To address security challenges, smart cities implement robust cybersecurity measures, including network monitoring, encryption, and intrusion detection systems. Detecting and mitigating possible security risks in drone network B5G is a crucial aspect of ensuring reliable and safe drone operation. It is necessary to establish sophisticated and robust attack detection techniques to defend against security threats as the use of drones becomes increasingly widespread and their applications diversify. This is due to the lack of privacy and security consideration in the drone's system, including an inadequate computation capability and unsecured wireless channels to perform advanced cryptographic algorithms. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) and anomaly detection systems can identify suspicious activities and monitor network traffic, such as anomalous communication patterns or unauthorized access attempts. Therefore, the study presents an enhanced dwarf mongoose optimization algorithm with deep learning-based attack detection (EDMOA-DLAD) in Networks B5G for the purpose of Drones technique. The presented EDMOA-DLAD technique aims to recognize the attacks and classifies them on the drone network B5G. Primarily, the EDMOA-DLAD technique designs a feature selection (FS) approach using EDMOA. To detect attacks, the EDMOA-DLAD technique uses a deep variational autoencoder (DVAE) classifier. Finally, the EDMOA-DLAD technique applies the beetle antenna search (BAS) technique for the optimum hyperparameter part of DVAE model. The outcome of EDMOA-DLAD approach can be verified on benchmark datasets. A wide range of simulations inferred that the EDMOA-DLAD method obtains enhanced performance of 99.79% over other classification techniques. © 2024 The Authors},

abstract={As the world increasingly becomes more interconnected, the demand for safety and security is ever-increasing, particularly for industrial networks. This has prompted numerous researchers to investigate different methodologies and techniques suitable for intrusion detection systems (IDS) requirements. Over the years, many studies have proposed various solutions in this regard, including signature-based and machine learning (ML)-based systems. More recently, researchers are considering deep learning (DL)-based anomaly detection approaches. Most proposed works in this research field aim to achieve either one or a combination of high accuracy, considerably low false alarm rates (FARs), high classification specificity and detection sensitivity, lightweight DL models, or other ML and DL-related performance measurement metrics. In this study, we propose a novel method to convert a raw dataset to an image dataset to magnify patterns by utilizing the Short-Term Fourier transform (STFT). The resulting high-quality image dataset allowed us to devise an anomaly detection system for IDS using a simple lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) that classifies denial of service and distributed denial of service. The proposed methods were evaluated using a modern dataset, CSE-CIC-IDS2018, and a legacy dataset, NSLKDD. We have also applied a combined dataset to assess the generalization of the proposed model across various datasets. Our experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed methods achieved high accuracy and considerably low FARs with high specificity and sensitivity. The resulting loss and accuracy curves have demonstrated the efficacy of our raw dataset to image dataset conversion methodology, which is evident as an excellent generalization of the proposed lightweight CNN model was observed, effectively avoiding overfitting. This holds for both the modern and legacy datasets, including their mixed versions. © 2024 by the authors.},

abstract={This study describes improving network security by implementing and assessing an intrusion detection system (IDS) based on deep neural networks (DNNs). The paper investigates contemporary technical ways for enhancing intrusion detection performance, given the vital relevance of safeguarding computer networks against harmful activity. The DNN-based IDS is trained and validated by the model using the NSL-KDD dataset, a popular benchmark for IDS research. The model performs well in both the training and validation stages, with 91.30% training accuracy and 94.38% validation accuracy. Thus, the model shows good learning and generalization capabilities with minor losses of 0.22 in training and 0.1553 in validation. Furthermore, for both macro and micro averages across class 0 (normal) and class 1 (anomalous) data, the study evaluates the model using a variety of assessment measures, such as accuracy scores, precision, recall, and F1 scores. The macro-average recall is 0.9422, the macro-average precision is 0.9482, and the accuracy scores are 0.942. Furthermore, macro-averaged F1 scores of 0.9245 for class 1 and 0.9434 for class 0 demonstrate the model's ability to precisely identify anomalies precisely. The research also highlights how real-time threat monitoring and enhanced resistance against new online attacks may be achieved byDNN-based intrusion detection systems,which can significantly improve network security. The study underscores the critical function ofDNN-based IDS in contemporary cybersecurity procedures by setting the foundation for further developments in this field. Upcoming research aims to enhance intrusion detection systems by examining cooperative learning techniques and integrating up-to-date threat knowledge. © 2024 Tech Science Press.

abstract={With the increasing popularity of technologies that depend on computer networks, providing security is of paramount importance. Consequently, intrusion detection systems (IDS) play a vital role in monitoring these networks. An essential element in securing the network of an organization is the Intrusion Detection System (IDS), which serves as the primary barrier against cyber threats and is tasked with thwarting illegal entry into the network. Flow-based network traffic analysis is commonly used in IDS solutions to identify security concerns. In recent years, several innovative strategies have been proposed and implemented to address the issue of network security, with a specific focus on Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). The creation of intrusion detection systems using AI methods is a modern method for finding breaches in a network. Since there are many possible approaches, it is important to have a standardized method that facilitates good judgement when classifying intrusions. This paper presents a novel approach utilizing deep learning and machine learning modelling to develop a model for multi-class classification. The principal objective is to create IDS that can effectively detect anomalies using flow-based analysis. The latest CICIDS2017 dataset is used in experimentation for testing and training. The experiments performed with a deep learning model for IDS produced promising results, achieving a 99.77% accuracy rate for multi-class classification while employing the specific dataset. © 2024, International Publications.

abstract={Despite the many advantages offered by Host Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS), they are rarely adopted in mainstream cybersecurity strategies. Unlike Network Intrusion Detection Systems, a HIDS is the last layer of defence between potential attacks and the underlying OSs. One of the main reasons behind this is its poor capabilities to adequately protect against zero-day attacks. With the rising number of zero-day exploits and related attacks, this is an increasingly imperative requirement for a modern HIDS. In this paper variational long short-term memory — recurrent autoencoder approach which improves zero-day attack detection is proposed. We have practically implemented our model using TensorFlow and evaluated its performance using benchmark ADFA-LD and UNM datasets. We have also compared the results against those from notable publications in the area. © 2024 Saint Petersburg State University. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This study introduces a deep learning approach for network intrusion detection (NIDS), which excels in both binary and multi-classification tasks. This approach combines the strengths of six distinct deep learning algorithms: DNN, CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU, and a Hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture. The NSL-KDD dataset, a widely recognized benchmark for intrusion detection research, was utilized for implementation and evaluation. In binary classification, the approach demonstrates exceptional capabilities, with the GRU approach outperforming others. Similarly, the DNN, LSTM, CNN, and RNN approaches exhibit robust performance, showcasing their efficacy in detecting anomalies within network data. In the multi-classification setting, the DNN approach stands out with outstanding performance. While other approaches, including RNN, CNN, LSTM, GRU, and the Hybrid CNN-LSTM approach, also maintain commendable results, the DNN approach proves to be the most effective in handling complex network patterns. This research provides valuable insights into the application of deep learning approaches using the NSL-KDD dataset for network anomaly detection, emphasizing their versatility and reliability across different classification scenarios. The findings lay the groundwork for further exploration and utilization of deep learning methodologies in enhancing network security. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In recent times, the massive expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) has transformed various facets of everyday life and industries. The compelling cause behind the widespread adoption of IoT is the increasing availability of affordable, compact, and energy-efficient computing devices. While these devices offer significant benefits, they also raise substantial security and privacy challenges. Consequently, safeguarding IoT networks and devices is imperative. To raise a robust security system for IoT networks, it is crucial to have an efficient anomaly-based intrusion detection system. In this study, we introduce a meticulous methodology to create IoT-specific datasets. Utilizing the Contiki-OS Cooja simulator, we generate datasets representative of real-world IoT security threats, including sinkholes, version numbers, and flooding attacks. We then evaluate the performance of a Convolutional Neural Network paired with an Aquila Optimizer (CNN-AO) using these self-generated datasets, by employing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and false alarm rate. Additionally, we compare the effectiveness of CNN and LSTM models in distinguishing between benign and malicious traffic. Our findings demonstrate that the CNN-AO model surpasses other models in accurately classifying normal and malicious traffic with an accuracy of 99.22, 99.77, and 99.55% for our self-generated malicious datasets based on sinkhole attack, version number attack, and flooding attack respectively. This novel approach not only establishes a solid foundation for future investigations in this domain but also provides valuable insights into enhancing IoT system security. In this study, we contribute to the field by introducing a robust methodology for IoT-specific dataset generation and evaluating a cutting-edge CNN-AO model for intrusion detection. Furthermore, it is crucial to note that this research was conducted with utmost ethical consideration. Ethical guidelines and data privacy concerns were meticulously addressed during the generation of IoT datasets and the simulation of real-world attack scenarios, ensuring the responsible conduct of our study. © 2024 Vandana Choudhary, Sarvesh Tanwar and Tanupriya Choudhury.

abstract={Software-defined networks (SDNs), while offering a revolutionary global view of the network, remain susceptible to a variety of attacks. This vulnerability necessitates innovative solutions for preserving data privacy and enhancing network security. The work presented herein introduces an innovative network anomaly detection methodology leveraging both federated learning (FL) and deep learning (DL) techniques. In contrast to traditional collaborative learning, where potential privacy compromises arise from the distribution of local training data to a central server, the proposed methodology enables each switch in the network to collect data from its connected hosts and independently train a local Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. Subsequently, each switch encrypts and forwards its model parameters to the controller. Upon receipt, the controller decrypts the parameters from each switch, computes their average, and formulates a global LSTM model. This model is disseminated to every switch in the network, enabling each host to retrain its local model according to the global parameters. This iterative process is conducted multiple times to maintain the timeliness of the information. Evaluation of the proposed methodology using the UNSW-NB15 dataset, in conjunction with NF-UQ-NIDSv2 and CICIDS2017 datasets, demonstrated its efficacy in anomaly detection, with performance exceeding a 96.75% accuracy rate. © 2023 International Information and Engineering Technology Association.

abstract={Driver behavior features extracted from the controller area network (CAN) have potential applications in improving vehicle safety. However, the development of a classifier-based intrusion detection system (IDS) for in-vehicle networks remains an open research problem. To address this challenge, we incorporate novel n -fold cross-validation windowing techniques on two publicly available driving behavior datasets. A driver classification-based IDS is proposed using the LSTM-FCN model that utilizes the strengths of both fully convolutional network (FCN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. These modules allow the model to learn spatial and temporal features and utilize contextual information. In addition, we combine three squeeze and excite (SnE) layers following FCN layers to incorporate adjacent spatial locations and augment a scaled dot product attention mechanism into the LSTM to improve its feature selection and extraction capabilities. Our proposed IDS uses hacking and countermeasure research lab (HCRL) and test datasets, which achieve an improvement in accuracy of 4.18% and 13.99% respectively, from the baseline LSTM-FCN model. The experimental results of our method exhibited an overall accuracy of 99.36% and 96.36% for both datasets and outperformed various state-of-the-art methods. © 2023 The Authors.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) networks leverage wireless communication protocol, which adversaries can exploit. Impersonation attacks, injection attacks, and flooding are several examples of different attacks existing in Wi-Fi networks. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) became one solution to distinguish those attacks from benign traffic. Deep learning techniques have been intensively utilized to classify the attacks. However, the main issue of utilizing deep learning models is projecting the data, notably tabular data, into image-based data. This study proposes a novel projection from wireless network attacks data into grid-like data for feeding one of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, EfficientNet. We define the particular sequence of placing the attribute values in a matrix that would be captured as an image. By combining the most important subset of attributes and EfficientNet, we aim for an accurate and lightweight IDS module deployed in IoT networks. We examine the proposed model using the Wi-Fi attacks dataset, called AWID dataset. We achieve the best performance by a 99.91% F1 score and 0.11% false positive rate. In addition, our proposed model achieved comparable results with other statistical machine learning models, which shows that our proposed model successfully exploited the spatial information of tabular data to maintain detection accuracy. We also successfully maintain the false positive rate of about 0.11%. We also compared the proposed model with other machine learning models, and it is shown that our proposed model achieved comparable results with the other three models. We believe the spatial information must be considered by projecting the tabular data into grid-like data. © 2022 River Publishers.},

abstract={An intrusion detection system is an automated monitoring tool that analyzes network traffic and detects malicious activities by looking out either for known patterns of attacks or for an anomaly. In this study, intrusion detection and classification performances of different deep learning based systems are examined. For this purpose, 24 deep neural networks with four different architectures are trained and evaluated on CICIDS2017 dataset. Furthermore, the best performing model is utilized to inspect raw network traffic features and rank them with respect to their contributions to success rates. By selecting features with respect to their ranks, sets of varying size from 3 to 77 are assessed in terms of classification accuracy and time efficiency. The results show that recurrent neural networks with a certain level of complexity can achieve comparable success rates with state-of-the-art systems using a small feature set of size 9; while the average time required to classify a test sample is halved compared to the complete set. © TÜBİTAK},

abstract={The presence of threats and anomalies in the Internet of Things infrastructure is a rising concern. Attacks, such as Denial of Service, User to Root, Probing, and Malicious operations can lead to the failure of an Internet of Things system. Traditional machine learning methods rely entirely on feature engineering availability to determine which data features will be considered by the model and contribute to its training and classification and “dimensionality” reduction techniques to find the most optimal correlation between data points that influence the outcome. The performance of the model mostly depends on the features that are used. This reliance on feature engineering and its effects on the model performance has been demonstrated from the perspective of the Internet of Things intrusion detection system. Unfortunately, given the risks associated with the Internet of Things intrusion, feature selection considerations are quite complicated due to the subjective complexity. Each feature has its benefits and drawbacks depending on which features are selected. Deep structured learning is a subcategory of machine learning. It realizes features inevitably out of raw data as it has a deep structure that contains multiple hidden layers. However, deep learning models such as recurrent neural networks can capture arbitrary-length dependencies, which are difficult to handle and train. However, it is suffering from exploiting and vanishing gradient problems. On the other hand, the log-cosh conditional variational Autoencoder ignores the detection of the multiple class classification problem, and it has a high level of false alarms and a not high detection accuracy. Moreover, the Autoencoder ignores to detect multi-class classification. Furthermore, there is evidence that a single convolutional neural network cannot fully exploit the rich information in network traffic. To deal with the challenges, this research proposed a novel approach for network anomaly detection. The proposed model consists of multiple convolutional neural networks, gate-recurrent units, and a bi-directional-long-short-term memory network. The proposed model employs multiple convolution neural networks to grasp spatial features from the spatial dimension through network traffic. Furthermore, gate recurrent units overwhelm the problem of gradient disappearing- and effectively capture the correlation between the features. In addition, the bi-directional-long short-term memory network approach was used. This layer benefits from preserving the historical context for a long time and extracting temporal features from backward and forward network traffic data. The proposed hybrid model improves network traffic's accuracy and detection rate while lowering the false positive rate. The proposed model is evaluated and tested on the intrusion detection benchmark NSL-KDD dataset. Our proposed model outperforms other methods, as evidenced by the experimental results. The overall accuracy of the proposed model for multi-class classification is 99.31% and binary-class classification is 99.12%. © 2024 The Author(s)},

abstract={The increasing complexity and adversity of cyber-attacks have prompted discussions in the cyber scenario for a prognosticate approach, rather than a reactionary one. In this paper, a signature-based intrusion detection system has been built based on C5 classifiers, to classify packets into normal and attack categories. Next, an anomaly-based intrusion detection was built based on the LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) algorithm to detect anomalies. These anomalies are then fed into the signature generator to extract attributes. These attributes get uploaded into the C5 training set, aiding the ensemble model in continual learning with expanding signatures of unknown attacks. By generating signatures of unknown attacks, the self-healing attribute of the ensemble model contributes to the early detection of attacks. For the C5 classifier, the proposed model is evaluated on the UNSW-NB15 dataset, while for the LSTM model, it is evaluated on the ADFA-LD dataset. Compared to conventional models, the experimental results show better detection rates for both known and unknown attacks. The C5 classifier achieved a True Positive Rate of 97% while maintaining a false positive rate of 8%. Also, the LSTM model achieved a detection rate of 90% while retaining a 17% False Alarm Rate. As the proposed model learns, its performance in real network traffic also improves and it also eliminates human intervention when updating training data. © The Author(s) 2024.},

abstract={Today’s environment demands that cybersecurity be given top priority because of the increase in cyberattacks and the development of quantum computing capabilities. Traditional security measures have relied on cryptographic techniques to safeguard information systems and networks. However, with the adaptation of artificial intelligence (AI), there is an opportunity to enhance cybersecurity through learning-based methods. IoT environments, in particular, work with lightweight systems that cannot handle the large data communications typically required by traditional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) to find anomalous patterns, making it a challenging problem. A deep learning-based framework is proposed in this study with various optimizations for automatically detecting and classifying cyberattacks. These optimizations involve dimensionality reduction, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering. Additionally, the framework utilizes an enhanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) variant called Intelligent Intrusion Detection Network (IIDNet) to detect and classify attacks efficiently. Layer optimization at the architectural level is used to improve detection performance in IIDNet using a Learning-Based Intelligent Intrusion Detection (LBIID) algorithm. The experimental study conducted in this paper uses a benchmark dataset known as UNSW-NB15 and demonstrated that IIDNet achieves an outstanding accuracy of 95.47% while significantly reducing training time and excellent scalability, outperforming many existing intrusion detection models. © 2024 by the authors.},

abstract={In the rapidly evolving landscape of network communication systems, the need for robust security measures has become paramount due to increased vulnerability to cyber threats. Traditional Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) face challenges in efficiently handling redundant features, leading to increased computational complexity. This research addresses these challenges by proposing two optimized IDSs leveraging Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) combined with deep learning (DL) models. The first system integrates Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) with GWO (GRU-GWO), while the second utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with GWO (LSTM-GWO). These systems aim to enhance feature selection, reducing dimensionality and improving detection accuracy. The NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 datasets, representative of contemporary network environments, were employed to evaluate the proposed systems. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in intrusion detection accuracy and computational efficiency, underscoring the efficacy of the DL-GWO approach in enhancing network security. The first approach (GRU-GWO-FS) increased accuracy to 90% and 79% for anomaly and signature-based detection on the UNSW-NB15 dataset, compared to 80% and 77% with all features. The second approach (LSTM-GWO-FS) achieved 93% and 79%, compared to 82% and 77%. On the NSL-KDD dataset, GRU-GWO-FS improved accuracy to 94% and 92%, and LSTM-GWO-FS to 94% and 92% for anomaly and signature-based detection, respectively. © The Author(s) 2024.},

abstract={The widespread availability of internet services has led to a surge in network attacks, raising serious concerns about cybersecurity. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are pivotal in safeguarding networks by identifying malicious activities, including denial of service (DoS), distributed denial of service (DDoS), botnet, brute force, probe, remote-to-local, and user-to-root attacks. To counter these threats effectively, this research focuses on utilizing unsupervised learning to train detection models. The proposed method involves employing auto-encoders (AE) for attack detection and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) for attack clustering. By using preprocessed and unlabeled normal network traffic data, the approach enables the identification of unknown attacks while minimizing the impact of imbalanced training data on model performance. The autoencoder method utilizes the reconstruction error as an anomaly detection metric, while DBSCAN employs a density-based approach to identify clusters, manage noise, accommodate diverse shapes, automatically determine cluster count, ensure scalability, and minimize false positives. Tested on standard datasets such as KDDCup99, UNSW-NB15, CICIDS2017, and CSE-CIC-IDS2018, this proposed model achieves accuracies exceeding 98.36%, 98.22%, 98.45%, and 98.51%, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of unsupervised learning in detecting and clustering novel intrusions while managing imbalanced data. © 2024, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

abstract={To address the class imbalance issue in network intrusion detection, which degrades performance of intrusion detection models, this paper proposes a novel generative model called VAE-WACGAN to generate minority class samples and balance the dataset. This model extends the Variational Autoencoder Generative Adversarial Network (VAEGAN) by integrating key features from the Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (ACGAN) and the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP). These enhancements significantly improve both the quality of generated samples and the stability of the training process. By utilizing the VAE-WACGAN model to oversample anomalous data, more realistic synthetic anomalies that closely mirror the actual network traffic distribution can be generated. This approach effectively balances the network traffic dataset and enhances the overall performance of the intrusion detection model. Experimental validation was conducted using two widely utilized intrusion detection datasets, UNSW-NB15 and CIC-IDS2017. The results demonstrate that the VAE-WACGAN method effectively enhances the performance metrics of the intrusion detection model. Furthermore, the VAE-WACGAN-based intrusion detection approach surpasses several other advanced methods, underscoring its effectiveness in tackling network security challenges. © 2024 by the authors.},

abstract={As network technology evolves, cyberattacks are not only increasing in frequency but also becoming more sophisticated. To proactively detect and prevent these cyberattacks, researchers are developing intrusion detection systems (IDSs) leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques. However, a significant challenge with these advanced models is the increased training time as model complexity grows, and the symmetry between performance and training time must be taken into account. To address this issue, this study proposes a fast-persistent-contrastive-divergence-based deep belief network (FPCD-DBN) that offers both high accuracy and rapid training times. This model combines the efficiency of contrastive divergence with the powerful feature extraction capabilities of deep belief networks. While traditional deep belief networks use a contrastive divergence (CD) algorithm, the FPCD algorithm improves the performance of the model by passing the results of each detection layer to the next layer. In addition, the mix of parameter updates using fast weights and continuous chains makes the model fast and accurate. The performance of the proposed FPCD-DBN model was evaluated on several benchmark datasets, including NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CIC-IDS-2017. As a result, the proposed method proved to be a viable solution as the model performed well with an accuracy of 89.4% and an F1 score of 89.7%. By achieving superior performance across multiple datasets, the approach shows great potential for enhancing network security and providing a robust defense against evolving cyber threats. © 2024 by the authors.},

abstract={In the current network security framework, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) happen to be among the major players in ensuring that the network activity is being monitored round the clock for any intrusions which may occur. The rising degree of cyber threats’ intricacy enforces the constant development of IDS methodologies to maintain effectiveness in detecting and reversing the emergence of any extra risks. Therefore, to settle the matter featured by, this research studies try to incorporate the most powerful metaheuristic algorithms, Lion Optimization Algorithm (LOA) and Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) in particular, to develop better detection accuracy and efficiency. The core obstacle recognized in this article is the fact that many systems of IDS send out false alarms and their mechanisms of detection of the true anomalies need to be improved immensely. In a nutshell, the change would unveil a fresh way of using LOA and GWO using them to promote the enhancement of internet defences systems in real-time. These schemes can discover previously unknown weaknesses or stealthy attacks. The core of this undertaking would consist in the conception and implementing of a Hybrid Network Intrusion Detection System, which will be created by blending the Lion Optimization Feature Selection (LOFS) and GWO smelters, denoted as LOFSGWO. Critically, the main purpose is to incorporate the GWO as a tool in the operations to cut down the dangerous parameters favourable towards an intrusion mechanism in the framework of a Hybrid CNN-LSTM Deep Learning system. Model tests reveal over 99.26% accuracy of low negative samples into out of a box that are served as testing as well as NSL-KDD dataset, which are similar to the simulation of WUSTL-EOM 2020 system. The obtained outcomes verify the relevance and efficiency of the suggested strategy, which may be used in the resolution of the issues faced in a network security today. © 2024, University of Diyala.

abstract={Smart healthcare is one of the promising areas of the Internet of Things (IoT), particularly in the case of the Covid-19 pandemic. Real-time patient monitoring and remote diagnostics facilitate better medical services to preserve human lives using Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) technology. Regardless of the numerous benefits, IoMT devices are susceptible to sophisticated cyber-attacks at a breakneck pace, which lead to tampering with healthcare data and threaten patients' lives. In a similar context, the 2022 ransomware cyber-attack on Versailles André-Mignot Hospital compromised the healthcare system and disclosed tremendous amounts of patient information. Towards this direction, most researchers have solely developed either machine learning or Deep learning algorithms to identify network traffic anomalies. Motivated by the above challenges, an effort has been made in this paper to design a Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) integrated with machine learning paradigms and a Ridge regression merged into deep learning models for implementing accurate anomaly intrusion detection based on the real-time dataset WUSTL-EHMS. Among the paradigms used, the proposed approach confirms that the RFE-based Decision Tree (DT) outperforms state-of-the-art techniques with a training accuracy of 99 % and a testing accuracy of 97.85 % while maintaining a reduction of FAR to 0.03. In a nutshell, it has been proven that the suggested framework can be deployed to build anomaly intrusion detection, reinforcing IoMT against widespread cyber-attacks and safeguarding the integrity of advanced healthcare systems. © 2024 The Authors},

abstract={Intrusion detection systems (IDS) play a pivotal role in network security and anomaly detection and are significantly impacted by the feature selection (FS) process. As a significant task in machine learning and data analysis, FS is directed toward pinpointing a subset of pertinent features that primarily influence the target variable. This paper proposes an innovative approach to FS, leveraging the forward selection search algorithm with hybrid objective/fitness functions such as correlation, entropy, and variance. The approach is evaluated using the BoT-IoT and TON_IoT datasets. By employing the proposed methodology, our bidirectional long-short term memory (BiLSTM) model achieved an accuracy of 98.42% on the TON_IoT dataset and 98.7% on the BoT-IoT dataset. This superior classification accuracy underscores the efficacy of the synergized BiLSTM deep learning model and the innovative FS approach. The study accentuates the potency of the proposed hybrid approach in FS for IDS and highlights its substantial contribution to achieving high classification performance in internet of things (IoT) network traffic analysis. © 2024, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

abstract={In recent years, the internet has not only enhanced the quality of our lives but also made us susceptible to high-frequency cyber-attacks on communication networks. Detecting such attacks on network traffic is made possible by intrusion detection systems (IDS). IDSs can be broadly divided into two groups based on the type of detection they provide. According to the established rules, the first signature-based IDS detects threats. Secondly, anomaly-based IDS detects abnormal conditions in the network. Various machine and deep learning approaches have been used to detect anomalies in network traffic in the past. To improve the detection of anomalies in network traffic, researchers have compared several machine learning models, such as support vector machines (SVM), logistic regressions (LRs), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Nave Bayes (NBs), and boosting algorithms. The accuracy, precision, and recall of many studies have been satisfactory to an extent. Therefore, this paper proposes an ensemble learning-based stacking classifier (ELSC) to achieve a better accuracy rate. In the proposed ELSC algorithm, KNN, NB, LR, and Decision Trees (DT) served as the base classifiers, while SVM served as the meta classifier. Based on a Network Intrusion detection dataset provided by Kaggle.com, ELSC is compared to base classifiers such as KNN, NB, LR, DT, SVM, and Linear Discriminate Analysis. As a result of the simulations, the proposed ELBS stacking classifier was found to outperform the other comparative models and converge with an accuracy of 99.4%. © 2024 The Author(s).

abstract={As an enhanced version of standard CAN, the Controller Area Network with Flexible Data (CAN-FD) rate is vulnerable to attacks due to its lack of information security measures. However, although anomaly detection is an effective method to prevent attacks, the accuracy of detection needs further improvement. In this paper, we propose a novel intrusion detection model for the CAN-FD bus, comprising two sub-models: Anomaly Data Detection Model (ADDM) for spotting anomalies and Anomaly Classification Detection Model (ACDM) for identifying and classifying anomaly types. ADDM employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers to capture the long-range dependencies and temporal patterns within CAN-FD frame data, thus identifying frames that deviate from established norms. ACDM is enhanced with the attention mechanism that weights LSTM outputs, further improving the identification of sequence-based relationships and facilitating multi-attack classification. The method is evaluated on two datasets: a real-vehicle dataset including frames designed by us based on known attack patterns, and the CAN-FD Intrusion Dataset, developed by the Hacking and Countermeasure Research Lab. Our method offers broader applicability and more refined classification in anomaly detection. Compared with existing advanced LSTM-based and CNN-LSTM-based methods, our method exhibits superior performance in detection, achieving an improvement in accuracy of 1.44% and 1.01%, respectively. © 2024 by the authors.},

abstract={In the realm of network intrusion detection, the escalating complexity and diversity of cyber threats necessitate innovative approaches to enhance detection accuracy. This study introduces an integrated solution leveraging deep learning techniques for improved intrusion detection. The proposed framework consists on a deep autoencoder for feature extraction, and a stacked long short-term memory (LSTM) network ensemble for classification. The deep autoencoder compresses raw network data, extracting salient features and mitigating noise. Subsequently, the stacked LSTM ensemble captures intricate temporal dependencies, correcting anomaly detection precision. Experiments conducted on the UNSW-NB15 dataset, and a benchmark in intrusion detection validate the effectiveness of the approach. The solution achieves an accuracy of 90.59%, with precision, recall, and F1-Score metrics reaching 90.65, 90.59, and 90.57, respectively. Notably, the framework outperforms standalone models and demonstrates the advantage of synergizing deep autoencoder-driven feature extraction with the stacked LSTM ensemble. Furthermore, a binary classification experiment attains an accuracy of about 90.59%, surpassing the multiclass classification and affirming the model's potential for binary threat identification. Comparative analyses highlight the pivotal role of feature extraction, while experimentation illustrates the enhancement achieved by incorporating the synergistic deep autoencoder-Stacked LSTM approach. © 2024 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

abstract={Due to the recent advances in the Internet and communication technologies, network systems and data have evolved rapidly. The emergence of new attacks jeopardizes network security and make it really challenging to detect intrusions. Multiple network attacks by an intruder are unavoidable. Our research targets the critical issue of class imbalance in intrusion detection, a reflection of the real-world scenario where legitimate network activities significantly out number malicious ones. This imbalance can adversely affect the learning process of predictive models, often resulting in high false-negative rates, a major concern in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). By focusing on datasets with this imbalance, we aim to develop and refine advanced algorithms and techniques, such as anomaly detection, costsensitive learning, and oversampling methods, to effectively handle such disparities. The primary goal is to create models that are highly sensitive to intrusions while minimizing false alarms, an essential aspect of effective IDS. This approach is not only practical for realworld applications but also enhances the theoretical understanding of managing class imbalance in machine learning. Our research, by addressing these significant challenges, is positioned to make substantial contributions to cybersecurity, providing valuable insights and applicable solutions in the fight against digital threats and ensuring robustness and relevance in IDS development. An intrusion detection system (IDS) checks network traffic for security, availability, and being non-shared. Despite the efforts of many researchers, contemporary IDSs still need to further improve detection accuracy, reduce false alarms, and detect new intrusions. The mean convolutional layer (MCL), feature-weighted attention (FWA) learning, a bidirectional long short-term memory (BILSTM) network, and the random forest algorithm are all parts of our unique hybrid model called MCL-FWA-BILSTM. The CNN-MCL layer for feature extraction receives data after preprocessing. After convolution, pooling, and flattening phases, feature vectors are obtained. The BI-LSTM and self-attention feature weights are used in the suggested method to mitigate the effects of class imbalance. The attention layer and the BI-LSTM features are concatenated to create mapped features before feeding them to the random forest algorithm for classification. Our methodology and model performance were validated using NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB-15, two widely available IDS datasets. The suggested model's accuracies on binary and multiclass classification tasks using the NSL-KDD dataset are 99.67% and 99.88%, respectively. The model's binary and multi-class classification accuracies on the UNSW-NB15 dataset are 99.56% and 99.45%, respectively. Further, we compared the suggested approach with other previous machine learning and deep learning models and found it to outperform them in detection rate, FPR, and F-score. For both binary and multiclass classifications, the proposed method reduces false positives while increasing the number of true positives. The model proficiently identifies diverse network intrusions on computer networks and accomplishes its intended purpose. The suggested model will be helpful in a variety of network security research fields and applications. Copyright: © 2024 Hashmi et al.},

abstract={Recent improvements in the internet of things (IoT), cloud services, and network data variety have increased the demand for complex anomaly detection algorithms in network intrusion detection systems (IDSs) capable of dealing with sophisticated network threats. Academics are interested in deep and machine learning (ML) breakthroughs because they have the potential to address complex challenges such as zero-day attacks. In comparison to firewalls, IDS are the initial line of network security. This study suggests merging supervised and unsupervised learning in identification systems IDS. Support vector machine (SVM) is an anomaly-based classification classifier. Deep autoencoder (DAE) lowers dimensionality. DAE are compared to principal component analysis (PCA) in this study, and hyper-parameters for F-1 micro score and balanced accuracy are specified. We have an uneven set of data classes. precision-recall curves, average precision (AP) score, train-test times, t-SNE, grid search, and L1/L2 regularization methods are used. KDDTrain+ and KDDTest+ datasets will be used in our model. For classification and performance, the DAE+SVM neural network technique is successful. Autoencoders outperformed linear PCA in terms of capturing valuable input attributes using t-SNE to embed high dimensional inputs on a two-dimensional plane. Our neural system outperforms solo SVM and PCA encoded SVM in multi-class scenarios. © 2024, Intelektual Pustaka Media Utama. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Traditional cyber security measures are becoming less effective, leading to rise in modern attacks. However, the ability to analyze and use massive volume of data (big data) to train anomaly based systems that can learn from experience, classify attacks and make decisions can improve prediction of attacks before they actually occur. In this study, to ensure availability, integrity, and confidentiality of information systems, predictive models for intrusion detection that use Big Data and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms were proposed. The proposed approach used a big dataset (CIC-Bell-IDS2017) to independently train three ML classifiers before and after feature selection. Big data analytics tool was also employed for feature scaling and selection in order to normalize data and select the most relevant set of features. Performance evaluation and comparative analysis were done and the results showed there were improvements in the models’ prediction accuracies. © 2024, Zarka Private University. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is an emerging technology that combines the Internet of Things (IoT) into the healthcare sector, which brings remarkable benefits to facilitate remote patient monitoring and reduce treatment costs. As IoMT devices become more scalable, Smart Healthcare Systems (SHS) have become increasingly vulnerable to cyberattacks. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a crucial role in maintaining network security. An IDS monitors systems or networks for suspicious activities or potential threats, safeguarding internal networks. This paper presents the development of an IDS based on deep learning techniques utilizing benchmark datasets. We propose a multilayer perceptron-based framework for intrusion detection within the smart healthcare domain. The primary objective of our work is to protect smart healthcare devices and networks from malicious attacks and security risks. We employ the NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 intrusion detection datasets to evaluate our proposed security framework. The proposed framework achieved an accuracy of 95.0674%, surpassing that of comparable deep learning models in smart healthcare while also reducing the false positive rate. Experimental results indicate the feasibility of using a multilayer perceptron, achieving superior performance against cybersecurity threats in the smart healthcare domain.

abstract={The surge in connected devices and massive data aggregation has expanded the scale of the Internet of Things (IoT) networks. The proliferation of unknown attacks and related risks, such as zero-day attacks and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks triggered by botnets, have resulted in information leakage and property damage. Therefore, developing an efficient and realistic intrusion detection system (IDS) is critical for ensuring IoT network security. In recent years, traditional machine learning techniques have struggled to learn the complex associations between multidimensional features in network traffic, and the excellent performance of deep learning techniques, as an advanced version of machine learning, has led to their widespread application in intrusion detection. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization Convolutional Neural Network Squeeze-and-Excitation (APSO-CNN-SE) model for implementing IoT network intrusion detection. A 2D CNN backbone is initially constructed to extract spatial features from network traffic. Subsequently, a squeeze-and-excitation channel attention mechanism is introduced and embedded into the CNN to focus on critical feature channels. Lastly, the weights and biases in the CNN-SE are extracted to initialize the population individuals of the APSO. As the number of iterations increases, the population’s position vector is continuously updated, and the cross-entropy loss function value is minimized to produce the ideal network architecture. We evaluated the models experimentally using binary and multiclassification on the UNSW-NB15 and NSL-KDD datasets, comparing and analyzing the evaluation metrics derived from each model. Compared to the base CNN model, the results demonstrate that APSO-CNN-SE enhances the binary classification detection accuracy by 1.84% and 3.53% and the multiclassification detection accuracy by 1.56% and 2.73% on the two datasets, respectively. Additionally, the model outperforms the existing models like DT, KNN, LR, SVM, LSTM, etc., in terms of accuracy and fitting performance. This means that the model can identify potential attacks or anomalies more precisely, improving the overall security and stability of the IoT environment. © 2024 The Authors.},

abstract={The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has revolutionized healthcare with remote patient monitoring and real-time diagnosis, but securing patient data remains a critical challenge due to sophisticated cyber threats and the sensitivity of medical information. Traditional machine learning methods struggle to capture the complex patterns in IoMT data, and conventional intrusion detection systems often fail to identify unknown attacks, leading to high false positive rates and compromised patient data security. To address these issues, we propose RCLNet, an effective Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection System (A-IDS) for IoMT. RCLNet employs a multi-faceted approach, including Random Forest (RF) for feature selection, the integration of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to enhance pattern recognition, and a Self-Adaptive Attention Layer Mechanism (SAALM) designed specifically for the unique challenges of IoMT. Additionally, RCLNet utilizes focal loss (FL) to manage imbalanced data distributions, a common challenge in IoMT datasets. Evaluation using the WUSTL-EHMS-2020 healthcare dataset demonstrates that RCLNet outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 99.78%, highlighting its potential to significantly improve the security and confidentiality of patient data in IoMT healthcare systems. 2024 Shaikh, Wang, Muhammad, Arshad, Owais, Alnashwan, Chelloug and Muthanna.},

abstract={The adoption and integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) have become essential for the advancement of many industries, unlocking purposeful connections between objects. However, the surge in IoT adoption and integration has also made it a prime target for malicious attacks. Consequently, ensuring the security of IoT systems and ecosystems has emerged as a crucial research area. Notably, advancements in addressing these security threats include the implementation of intrusion detection systems (IDS), garnering considerable attention within the research community. In this study, and in aim to enhance network anomaly detection, we present a novel intrusion detection approach: the Deep Neural Decision Forest-based IDS (DNDF-IDS). The DNDF-IDS incorporates an improved decision forest model coupled with neural networks to achieve heightened accuracy (ACC). Employing four distinct feature selection methods separately, namely principal component analysis (PCA), LASSO regression (LR), SelectKBest, and Random Forest Feature Importance (RFFI), our objective is to streamline training and prediction processes, enhance overall performance, and identify the most correlated features. Evaluation of our model on three diverse datasets (NSL-KDD, CICIDS2017, and UNSW-NB15) reveals impressive ACC values ranging from 94.09% to 98.84%, depending on the dataset and the feature selection method. Notably, our model achieves a remarkable prediction time of 0.1 ms per record. Comparative analyses with other recent random forest and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based models indicate that our DNDF-IDS performs similarly or even outperforms them in certain instances, particularly when utilizing the top 10 features. One key advantage of our novel model lies in its ability to make accurate predictions with only a few features, showcasing an efficient utilization of computational resources.

abstract={The modern digital environment is becoming increasingly interconnected, underscoring the critical need to safeguard network infrastructures. Detecting anomalies in network traffic remains essential as cyber threats continue to evolve. Analyzing trends, patterns, and relationships in network traffic data over time poses challenges. On the other hand, traditional generative neural networks emphasize detecting network attacks but encounter difficulties due to limitations in capturing the temporal and dynamic aspects of network traffic. This paper introduces a new methodology aimed at enhancing the identification of irregularities in network traffic using a Temporal Metric-Driven GRU Embedded Generative Neural Network (TMG-GRU-VAE). This method incorporates Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) into variational autoencoders to effectively train on the temporal characteristics of network traffic in temporal sequential networks. Moreover, we present a Temporal Correlation Index (TCI) score designed for anomaly detection in Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). This innovative metric offers a sophisticated and dynamic assessment of temporal behavior within network traffic. TCI's ability to distinguish between normal and anomalous temporal patterns plays a pivotal role in mitigating false positives. Our proposed method greatly improves the detection of small changes in abnormal sequences over time, enhancing accuracy by making anomalies stand out more clearly and reducing false alarms, thereby making the system more reliable. The proposed work, validated using the CIC-IDS-2017 and CIC-IDS-2018 datasets, demonstrates a significant decrease in False Positives (FP) across all models. Notable improvements range from 7.2% to 12.9% for the CIC-IDS-2017 dataset and from 7.1% to 14.1% for the CIC-IDS-2018 dataset. This highlights its significant impact on decreasing false positive rates. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) links various devices to digital services and significantly improves the quality of our lives. However, as IoT connectivity is growing rapidly, so do the risks of network vulnerabilities and threats. Many interesting Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are presented based on machine learning (ML) techniques to overcome this problem. Given the resource limitations of fog computing environments, a lightweight IDS is essential. This paper introduces a hybrid deep learning (DL) method that combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to build an energy-aware, anomaly-based IDS. We test this system on a recent dataset, focusing on reducing overhead while maintaining high accuracy and a low false alarm rate. We compare CICIoT2023, KDD-99 and NSL-KDD datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed IDS model based on key metrics, including latency, energy consumption, false alarm rate and detection rate metrics. Our findings show an accuracy rate over 92% and a false alarm rate below 0.38%. These results demonstrate that our system provides strong security without excessive resource use. The practicality of deploying IDS with limited resources is demonstrated by the successful implementation of IDS functionality on a Raspberry Pi acting as a Fog node. The proposed lightweight model, with a maximum power consumption of 6.12 W, demonstrates its potential to operate effectively on energy-limited devices such as low-power fog nodes or edge devices. We prioritize energy efficiency while maintaining high accuracy, distinguishing our scheme from existing approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate a significant reduction in false positives, ensuring accurate identification of genuine security threats while minimizing unnecessary alerts.

abstract={The recent development of the Internet of Things (IoTs) resulted in the growth of IoT-based DDoS attacks. The detection of Botnet in IoT systems implements advanced cybersecurity measures to detect and reduce malevolent botnets in interconnected devices. Anomaly detection models evaluate transmission patterns, network traffic, and device behaviour to detect deviations from usual activities. Machine learning (ML) techniques detect patterns signalling botnet activity, namely sudden traffic increase, unusual command and control patterns, or irregular device behaviour. In addition, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and signature-based techniques are applied to recognize known malware signatures related to botnets. Various ML and deep learning (DL) techniques have been developed to detect botnet attacks in IoT systems. To overcome security issues in an IoT environment, this article designs a gorilla troops optimizer with DL-enabled botnet attack detection and classification (GTODL-BADC) technique. The GTODL-BADC technique follows feature selection (FS) with optimal DL-based classification for accomplishing security in an IoT environment. For data preprocessing, the min-max data normalization approach is primarily used. The GTODL-BADC technique uses the GTO algorithm to select features and elect optimal feature subsets. Moreover, the multi-head attention-based long short-term memory (MHA-LSTM) technique was applied for botnet detection. Finally, the tree seed algorithm (TSA) was used to select the optimum hyperparameter for the MHA-LSTM method. The experimental validation of the GTODL-BADC technique can be tested on a benchmark dataset. The simulation results highlighted that the GTODL-BADC technique demonstrates promising performance in the botnet detection process. © 2024 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The coming 6G wireless network is poised to achieve unprecedented data rates, latency, and integration with newer technologies like AI and IoE. On the other hand, along with this kind of growth in the AI domain and the large-scale connectivity in 6G. It is also going to raise many security concerns at the level of intrusion detection and prevention. For intrusion detection, centralized approaches won't be able to work effectively, therefore there is an utmost need to design decentralized and privacy-preserving solutions. In this work, we propose a novel secure gradients exchange algorithm for distributed intrusion detection in 6G networks. Our method is designed to take into account the use of Federated Learning with secure multi-party computation and blockchain technology. This way ensures that the collaborating parties are able to conduct the training of intrusion detection models in a secure and collaborative manner by retaining privacy in the data. Gradient compression and adaptive secure aggregation strategies are used to further optimize communication overhead and computational complexity. Therefore, our design works in a robust and efficient manner with the high data rates and huge connectivity that 6G networks will provide. To achieve our goal, experiments using the CICIoT2023 dataset were performed, and results showed that our federated learning-based hybrid model composed of CNN1D and a multi-head attention mechanism outperformed other well-known deep learning models in terms of performance. It achieved the highest average accuracy with 79.92%, the highest average detection rate with 77.41%, and a low false alarm rate with 2.55%. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The rapid growth of computer networks emphasizes the urgency of addressing security issues. Organizations rely on network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and theft. These systems analyze network traffic to detect suspicious activities, such as attempted breaches or cyberattacks. However, existing studies lack a thorough assessment of class imbalances and classification performance for different types of network intrusions: wired, wireless, and software-defined networking (SDN). This research aims to fill this gap by examining these networks’ imbalances, feature selection, and binary classification to enhance intrusion detection system efficiency. Various techniques such as SMOTE, ROS, ADASYN, and SMOTETomek are used to handle imbalanced datasets. Additionally, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) identifies key features, and an autoencoder (AE) assists in feature extraction for the classification task. The study evaluates datasets such as AWID, UNSW, and InSDN, yielding the best results with different numbers of selected features. Bayesian optimization fine-tunes parameters, and diverse machine learning algorithms (SVM, kNN, XGBoost, random forest, ensemble classifiers, and autoencoders) are employed. The optimal results, considering F1-measure, overall accuracy, detection rate, and false alarm rate, have been achieved for the UNSW-NB15, preprocessed AWID, and InSDN datasets, with values of [0.9356, 0.9289, 0.9328, 0.07597], [0.997, 0.9995, 0.9999, 0.0171], and [0.9998, 0.9996, 0.9998, 0.0012], respectively. These findings demonstrate that combining Bayesian optimization with oversampling techniques significantly enhances classification performance across wired, wireless, and SDN networks when compared to previous research conducted on these datasets. © TÜBİTAK.},

abstract={The paper explores the evolving landscape of network security, in Software Defined Networking (SDN) highlighting the challenges faced by security measures as networks transition to software-based control. SDN revolutionizes Internet technology by simplifying network management and boosting capabilities through the OpenFlow protocol. It also brings forth security vulnerabilities. To address this we present a hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS) tailored for SDN environments leveraging a state of the art dataset optimized for SDN security analysis along with machine learning and deep learning approaches. This comprehensive research incorporates data preprocessing, feature engineering and advanced model development techniques to combat the intricacies of cyber threats in SDN settings. Our approach merges feature from the sine cosine algorithm (SCA) and tuna swarm optimization (TSO) to optimize the fusion of Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). By capturing both spatial aspects of network traffic dynamics our model excels at detecting and categorizing cyber threats, including zero-day attacks. Thorough evaluation includes analysis using confusion matrices ROC curves and classification reports to assess the model’s ability to differentiate between attack types and normal network behavior. Our research indicates that improving network security using software defined methods can be achieved by implementing learning and machine learning strategies paving the way, for more reliable and effective network administration solutions. © (2024), (Science and Information Organization).

abstract={Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are characterized by their integration of physical processes with computational and communication components. These systems are utilized in various critical infrastructure sectors, including energy, healthcare, transportation, and manufacturing, making them attractive targets for cyberattacks. Intrusion detection system (IDS) has played a pivotal role in identifying and mitigating cyber threats in CPS environments. Intrusion detection in secure CPSs is a critical component of ensuring the integrity, availability, and safety of these systems. The deep learning (DL) algorithm is extremely applicable for detecting cyberattacks on IDS in CPS systems. As a core element of network security defense, cyberattacks can change and breach the security of network systems, and then an objective of IDS is to identify anomalous behaviors and act properly to defend the network from outside attacks. Deep learning (DL) and Machine learning (ML) algorithms are crucial for the present IDS. We introduced an Equilibrium Optimizer with a Deep Recurrent Neural Networks Enabled Intrusion Detection (EODRNN-ID) technique in the Secure CPS platform. The main objective of the EODRNN-ID method concentrates mostly on the detection and classification of intrusive actions from the platform of CPS. During the proposed EODRNN-ID method, a min-max normalization algorithm takes place to scale the input dataset. Besides, the EODRNN-ID method involves EO-based feature selection approach to choose the feature and lessen high dimensionality problem. For intrusion detection, the EODRNN-ID technique exploits the DRNN model. Finally, the hyperparameter related to the DRNN model can be tuned by the chimp optimization algorithm (COA). The simulation study of the EODRNN-ID methodology is verified on a benchmark data. Extensive results display the significant performance of the EODRNN-ID algorithm when compared to existing techniques. © 2024 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.},

abstract={The continuous development of cyberattacks is threatening digital transformation endeavors worldwide and leads to wide losses for various organizations. These dangers have proven that signature-based approaches are insufficient to prevent emerging and polymorphic attacks. Therefore, this paper is proposing a Robust Malicious Executable Detection (RMED) using Host-based Machine Learning Classifier to discover malicious Portable Executable (PE) files in hosts using Windows operating systems through collecting PE headers and applying machine learning mechanisms to detect unknown infected files. The authors have collected a novel reliable dataset containing 116,031 benign files and 179,071 malware samples from diverse sources to ensure the efficiency of RMED approach. The most effective PE headers that can highly differentiate between benign and malware files were selected to train the model on 15 PE features to speed up the classification process and achieve real-time detection for malicious executables. The evaluation results showed that RMED succeeded in shrinking the classification time to 91 milliseconds for each file while reaching an accuracy of 98.42% with a false positive rate equal to 1.58. In conclusion, this paper contributes to the field of cybersecurity by presenting a comprehensive framework that leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods to proactively detect and prevent cyber-attacks. © 2024 Tech Science Press.

abstract={Due to the sensitive and mission-critical nature of the data collected and transferred, security in IoT-assisted UAV networks is of great significance. Intrusion detection in IoT-assisted UAV networks includes the deployment of complex monitoring systems to identify and respond to cyberattacks, physical breaches, or unauthorized access. This system employs a combination of anomaly detection and signature-based methods to find malicious or unusual activities within the network. A robust intrusion detection mechanism is essential for protecting the security and integrity of the UAVs and the data collected, ensuring that any possible vulnerabilities are promptly addressed and identified. Consequently, this study introduces an adaptive mongoose optimizer algorithm with a deep learning-based intrusion detection (AMOA-DLID) method in IoT-assisted UAV networks. The AMOA-DLID technique intends to ensure security in the IoT-assisted UAV networks via an intrusion detection process. In the presented AMOA-DLID technique, AMOA is initially applied for the feature selection process. The following sparse autoencoder (SAE) model can be exploited for the recognition of the intrusions. Lastly, the recognition rate of the SAE model can be improved by employing the Harris Hawks optimizer (HHO) technique. The detailed experimental study of the AMOA-DLID model is performed on the benchmark dataset of IDS. The extensive results portrayed that the AMOA-DLID technique reaches improved security over other models on the IoT-assisted UAV networks. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Modern technologies adopt Internet of Things (IoT) devices to increase water management efficiency and enhance water quality services. However, the limitations of IoT devices, such as small sizes and poor security, weaken the Water Distribution System (WDS) security, and many attackers compromise the critical components of WDS. Cyber-physical attacks (CPAs) are considered one of the biggest challenges that decrease the security factors in WDS by disrupting normal operations and tampering with the critical data of the water system. For instance, an attacker can change the water pump's speed, disrupting the service. An attacker can also alter the data of water quality parameters to contaminate the water. It is important to propose solutions to increase security in the WDS and defend against CPAs and security threats. Although several intrusion detection methods were proposed in the literature to detect WDS CPAs, many issues still need solutions, such as detecting attacks with smaller false alarms, minimizing the time to disclose the attacks, determining the location of the compromising components, and recovering solutions for the attacked components. Therefore, this paper proposes a model based on a deep learning algorithm called a Conditional variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to disclose CPAs and mitigate their bad effects on WDS. The proposed method consists of a neural network, an encoder to compress data, and a decoder to decompress data. The objective goal is to minimize the reconstruction error between the encoded-decoded data and the initial data. We apply the CVAE on some well-known datasets. The experiment results show that our proposed CVAE method performs better than others. After analyzing the CVAE model with other existing models, we get the highest performance by reaching %98 accuracy. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The use of Open Radio Access Networks (Open RAN) in vehicular networks can lead to better connectivity, reliability, and performance. However, communication in this setting is often done over an unsecured wireless network, which creates a challenge in verifying the validity of received transactions by Internet of Vehicles (IoV) due to the untrusted network. It also creates a potential for attackers to tamper with the data content and conduct different IoV-related attacks. To address these issues, a new framework named 'STIoV' has been proposed for secure and trustworthy communication in IoV. The framework includes a mutual authentication scheme to register and exchange session keys among the IoV participants, and a credit-based trust management system to assign reputation scores for the vehicular devices. The latter scheme discards transactions with low credit scores. To overcome the complexity and variability of the IoV network, digital twin technology is used to map Road Side Units (RSU) servers into virtual space, which facilitates constructing the vehicular relation model. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) based on deep learning techniques is also introduced to detect anomalies in the traffic flow. The legitimate data is further used by the blockchain scheme for transaction verification, block creation and addition. Finally, the proposed framework has been evaluated based on two network intrusion datasets, and the results show the accuracy and efficacy of STIoV in comparison to several recent state-of-the-art solutions. © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In recent years, the internet of things (IoT) has had a significant impact on our daily lives, offering various advantages for improving our quality of life. However, it is crucial to prioritize the security of IoT devices and the protection of user's personal data. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) play a critical role in maintaining data privacy and security. An IoT IDS continuously monitors network activity and identifies potential security risks or attacks targeting IoT devices. While traditional IDS solutions exist, intrusion detection heavily relies on artificial intelligence (AI). AI can greatly enhance the capabilities of IoT IDS through real-time monitoring, precise threat identification, and automatic response capabilities. It is essential to develop and utilize these technologies securely and responsibly to mitigate potential risks and safeguard user privacy. A hybrid IDS was proposed for anomaly-based and signature-based intrusions, leveraging convolutional neural network with long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM). The name of the proposed hybrid model is anomaly and signaturebased CNN-LSTM intrusion detection system (AS-CL IDS). The AS-CL IDS concentrated on two different IoT IDS detection strategies employing a combination of deep learning techniques. The model includes model training and testing as well as data preprocessing. The CIC-IDS 2018, IoT network intrusion dataset, MQTT-IoT-IDS2020, and BoTNeTIoTL01 datasets were used to train and test the AS-CL IDS. The overall performance of the proposed model was assessed using accepted assessment metrics. Despite reducing the number of characteristics, the model achieved 99.81% accuracy. Furthermore, a comparison was made between the proposed model and existing alternative models to demonstrate its productivity. As a result, the proposed model proves valuable for predicting IoT attacks. Looking ahead, the deployment strategy of the IoT IDS can anticipate the utilization of real-time datasets for future implementations. © 2023 Jinsi Jose and Deepa V. Jose.},

abstract={The rapid development of physical device-based data collection in emerging technology needs smart, secure, and intelligent transmission. Cyber physical systems compete with the requirement of intelligent transmission of data. In cyber physical systems, security is a very challenging task due to the heterogeneous connections of devices in real time. This paper proposes a novel methodology for cyber-attack finding in cyber physical systems. The proposed system employed a DNN-deep neural network for the categorization of normal and attack data. The employed deep neural network design for 4 hidden layers for the detection of anomalies. For the secured transmission, we employed the blockchain process in Ethereum. The process of Ethereum generates blocks of blockchain with headers and transmits data over the cyberworld to the physical world with the alteration of data. For the authentication of the projected algorithm tested on two real-time datasets, such as NSL-KDD15 and CIDDS_001. The working of proposed algorithm is very promising in compression of existing algorithms of deep learning like RNN-recurrent neural networks, DBN, and DNN. © JES 2023 on-line: journal.esrgroups.org},

abstract={To address the challenges posed by traditional network architectures, the Software-Defined Network (SDN) architecture was introduced. However, SDNs are not immune to many security threats (e.g. Dos, Backdoors). In this paper, we present an advanced intrusion detection system that leverages federated learning (FL) and deep learning (DL) techniques to check whether attacks occur or not on SDN. FL has been employed as a collaborative learning technique, enabling various data planes to conduct local training on their respective client datasets. Following local training on each data plane, the local model parameters are securely transmitted to the controller server. At the controller server, these local training parameters are aggregated to construct a global model. The resulting aggregation outcome is then shared back with each local model to update them, enhancing their ability to detect attacks. Three datasets were used to evaluate the efficacy of the suggested method: UNSW-NB15, NF-UQ-NIDS-v2, and CICIDS2017. The obtained results demonstrate a strong performance in anomaly detection, with an accuracy value reach to 95.68%. © 2023 WITPress. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The traditional industrial control security research mainly focuses on network intrusion detection or trapping system and lacks abnormal detection after intrusion, and the abnormal detection algorithm ability of the underlying operation data of industrial control is insufficient. The modern industrial control system is a side-cloud collaborative architecture that accesses the Internet, the edge side is usually an industrial computer with weak computing power, and the deep learning algorithm requires a lot of computing resources and is difficult to use directly on the edge side. In this paper, a lightweight convolutional neural network anomaly detection algorithm "SingleNet"suitable for the edge side of the industrial control system is proposed, which convolutes the data of each sensor for a period of time and calculates the feature correlation between points in the association calculation layer. Experimental results show that the accuracy rate on the oil depot dataset is increased from 73% to 99.4%, the training time is shortened from 2 hours to 3 minutes, and the model size is compressed from 101 MB to 1.6 MB. The accuracy rate is improved from 87% to 99.2% on the Mississippi dataset, the training time is shortened from 15 minutes to 3 minutes, and the model size is compressed from 10.6 MB to 1.63 MB. The accuracy rate is improved from 85% to 99.4% on the Batadal dataset, the training time is shortened from 18 minutes to 3 minutes, and the model size is compressed from 15.5 MB to 1.62 MB. Compared with several lightweight algorithms recently proposed, SqueezeNet, MobileNet, and ShuffleNet, the proposed algorithm has significantly improved the performance indicators of training speed, accuracy, model size, and iteration time on the industrial control datasets. Both the training and testing of the algorithm can be done on the CPU, making it possible to apply deep learning to the edge side of the industrial control system. © 2022 Yun Sha et al.},
